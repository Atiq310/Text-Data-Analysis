A

s the new government takes ofﬁce
after the 8th February General
Elections, expectations are that a
vibrant strategy and vision would help revive
the economy and build on the hard-earned
gains made over the last six months. Last
few months measures have restored market
conﬁdence and led to a pick-up in economic
activity. GDP growth accelerated to 2.1% in
Q1 FY2024, after two consecutive quarters
of negative growth. The growth was broadbased with the agriculture sector posting 5%
growth and manufacturing activity
registering 2.5% growth. In particular, the
removal of the import ban and other import
restrictions have eased supply constraints,
leading to pick-up in economic activity. Data
from Q2 FY2024 is showing stronger
performance of the manufacturing sector,
with large scale manufacturing posting 8.2%
increase over Q1. We expect Q2 FY2024
GDP growth to rise to around 3% on
stronger manufacturing output and higher
production of crops including cotton, which
has increased by 75% to 8.35 million bales.
To tackle these challenges, the caretaker
government has taken steps to reduce
unproductive expenditures and boost tax
and non-tax income. During Jul-Dec
FY2024, the government has run a primary

surplus of Rs 1.5 trillion (1.4% of GDP)
against IMF SBA target of 0.5% of GDP.
Difﬁcult and unpopular measures including
a reduction in the subsidy bill on power and
gas through timely implementation of
quarterly tariffs helped improve primary
account. No supplementary grants have
been issued during this period and PSDP
projects that fall under the provincial domain
have been transferred to provincial ADPs.
At the same time, we have increased the
release of funds for 9.3 million most
vulnerable households.
On the revenue side, the FBR Tax collection
grew by 30% to Rs 5.15 trillion during JulJan FY2024 despite a slowdown in imports
and 0% GST on petroleum products.
Overall growth in the domestic taxes has
increased by 40%, with the rebound in
economic activity and rise in proﬁtability of
companies including Banks, Oil & Gas, and
the manufacturing industry. Import taxes
posted a growth of 16% due to
improvements in the valuation of imports
that yielded Rs 151 billion in collections as
well as the anti-smuggling drive that
witnessed almost 69 % growth in FY2024.
The improvement in the ﬁscal position has
helped the government to reduce the
accumulation of public debt. Net domestic
borrowing has decreased by 67% to Rs 1.9
trillion, from Rs 5.8 trillion in the preceding
period. The lower domestic borrowing, lower
cost of borrowing on margin (below the SBP
policy rate) and extended maturity proﬁle
helped lower net domestic borrowing. Most
of all the domestic debt proﬁle has improved
to 3.1 years in Jan 2024, from 2.7 months in
Jun 2023. The government also
successfully launched a 1 year Sukuk on
the PSX, the ﬁrst auction was held in
November 2023, raising lower-cost debt
from non-bank and retail investors.
Similarly, external net borrowing during fell
to $ 0.3 billion, compared to $ 3bn in the
preceding period.
At the heart of the economic challenges
facing Pakistan today is the unsustainable
public debt position, with Pakistan in breach
of the Fiscal Responsibility & Debt
Limitation Act (FRDL) since 2013. The
government's ability to service the public
FEBRUARY - 2024

debt liabilities are hampered by weak tax
collection, rising losses of SOEs, and
highest interest rates since 1972.
The improvement in the ﬁscal position and
other quantitative and structural
benchmarks led to the successful ﬁrst
review of the IMF SBA in November 2023,
and subsequent disbursement of $ 700
million in January 2024. The measures
taken to conclude the IMF staff review
included the annual rebasing of power
tariffs, the semi-annual gas tariff
adjustment, and the SOE Policy to enhance
governance and improve ﬁnancial
performance. A comprehensive Circular
Debt Management Plan (CDMP) was
enforced that focused on reforms to reduce
high costs, improve DISCO performance,
and increase competition and green energy.
Headline Inﬂation has remained persistently
high, but we anticipate a signiﬁcant fall in
inﬂation in 2024 due to the economic
measures taken by the caretaker
government including improvement in the
supply of imports of raw materials, higher
food production, and stability in the
exchange rate market. Assuming no
exogenous shocks, including a rise in
international oil prices, the SBP projects
inﬂation to fall to 5% to 7% range by
FY2025. During the month of Feb 2024 the
weekly SPI inﬂation has declined to 30.7%
compared to 44% in Jan 2024.
Turning to the markets, the premium
between interbank and open market was
brought down to less than 0.5%, against the
agreed 1.25% range. SBP FX reserves
were raised to $ 8.1 billion, compared to $
4.4bn in June 2023, while reducing the
swaps from commercial banks to $ 3.5
billion, from $ 4.5 bn in June 2023.
The markets have rallied due to
improvements in the economic conditions
and the PSX has rallied 40% from Sep with
the KSE 100 index rising to 63,300 points
th
by 26 Feb. Foreign buyers have invested $
51.7 million in the PSX during FY2024, after
4 years of outﬂow. During the period, the
Rupee has strengthened 8% to 280 levels.
The risk premium (Credit Default Swaps) on
the Eurobonds has come down sharply to

1,534bps in Feb 2024, compared to
4,825bps in June 2023.
To sustain these gains, it is imperative that
the new government completes the last
review of the IMF SBA. Perhaps more
important is that the new government reach
an early agreement with the IMF staff on a
new medium-term facility, providing an
anchor to carry out the difﬁcult reforms. To
achieve this the new government must take
forward critical reforms on restructuring of
the FBR, privatization of the loss-making
SOEs including PIA, and the
implementation of the SOE policy for
improved governance and ﬁnancial
performance.

Executive
Summary
Economic instability is fading, with revival
efforts aimed at boosting the activity across
sectors. The real sector is experiencing
notable growth, leading to a positive market
response and signs of recovery. The PKR
has stabilized and the PSX has shown
sustained performance improvements,
reﬂecting a conducive environment for the
economic activity. Though the pace of
overall expansion is slow, but improvements
in major economic indicators signifying an
optimistic GDP outlook in FY2024.
Agriculture sector is experiencing stronger
growth as compared to last year. The robust
performance in this sector reﬂects better
situation of food security and employment
during the ongoing ﬁscal year. For the Rabi
season 2023-24, the timely sowing of wheat
aligns with the goal of reaching a production
target of 32.12 million tonnes, with
expectations for further increase in other
crops production due to favorable climatic
conditions. The farm tractor production and
sales registered signiﬁcant increase of 76.7
percent and 82.5 percent during JulyJanuary FY2024, respectively, compared to
the same period last year. A mixed trend
witnessed in fertilizer usage, urea off-take
dropped by 6.7 percent during OctoberJanuary whereas DAP off-take rose by 14.5

percent during the same period.
The LSM sector showcased an increase of
3.4 percent on YoY basis in December
2023, compared to 1.1 percent decline. On
MoM basis it increased by 15.7 percent in
December, against an increase of 3.6
percent in November. Overall, a minor
decline of 0.4 percent was recorded during
Jul-Dec FY2024, compared to a contraction
of 2.1 percent in the same period last year.
During Jul-Dec FY2024, 12 out of 22
sectors witnessed positive growth. The
positive sectors include Food, Beverages,
Wearing Apparel, Leather Products, Coke &
Petroleum Products, Chemicals,
Pharmaceuticals, Non-Metallic Mineral
Products, Rubber Products, Wood
Products, Machinery and Equipment and
others (including Football), while negative
growth observed in Tobacco, Textile, Paper
& Board, Iron & Steel Products, Fabricated
Metal, Computer, Electronics & Optical
Products, Automobiles, Electrical
Equipment, Furniture and Other Transport
Equipment.
The inﬂationary pressure remained
sustained in January, though anticipated to
fall in coming months. In January 2024, the
CPI inﬂation was recorded at 28.3 percent
on a year-on-year basis, up from 27.6
percent in January 2023. During Jul-Jan
FY2024, it has increased to 28.7 percent,
compared to 25.4 percent in the
corresponding period last year. The spike in
CPI is mainly driven by an increase in the
costs of Alcoholic Beverages & Tobacco,
Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas & Fuel,
Furnishing & Household Equipment
Maintenance, Perishable Food Items, NonPerishable Food Items, Transport, Health,
and Clothing & Footwear. The government
is providing relief measures including the
Ramzan Relief package, aimed at
supporting poor segment of the society
during the holy month of Ramzan in 2024.
On the ﬁscal front, during ﬁrst half of the
current ﬁscal year, a substantial rise in tax
and non-tax collection contributed to
improved revenue growth, leading to a
surplus in the primary balance. However,
the expenditure side remained under
signiﬁcant pressure due to higher markup

payments. Consequently, the ﬁscal deﬁcit
reached 2.3 percent of GDP compared to
2.0 percent of GDP last year. While the
primary surplus improved to 1.7 percent of
GDP during Jul-Dec FY2024, up from the
1.1 percent of GDP in the previous year.
On the external front, a sustained
improvement in trade balance is continued,
leading to improvement in the Current
Account Balance. During Jul-Jan FY2024,
the Current Account posted a deﬁcit of $1.1
billion against a deﬁcit of $ 3.8 billion last
year. The YoY exports increased by 21.2
percent to $ 2.7 billion in January 2024 as
compared to $ 2.2 billion in January 2023,
owing to ease in imports restriction and
exchange rate stability resulted in smooth
supply of raw material for export-oriented
industries. YoY imports increased by 16.0
percent to $4.5 billion in January 2024 as
compared to $ 3.9 billion same month last
year. Trade balance narrowed down by 9.1
percent to $ 1.8 billion in January 2024 as
against $ 1.7 billion last year. The total
foreign investment during Jul-Jan FY2024
recorded an inﬂow of $ 785.9 million as
against an outﬂow of $ 148.8 million last
year. During Jul-Jan FY2024, workers'
remittances recorded at $ 15.8 billion ($
16.3 billion last year), decreased by 3.0
percent. However, YoY remittances
increased by 26.2 percent in January 2024
($ 2.39 billion) as compared to January
2023 ($ 1.90 billion)
In monetary sector, the MPC has
maintained the policy rate at 22.0 percent in
th
its decision held on 29 January, 2024. The
decision based on the expectation of
decline in inﬂation in upcoming months.
During 1st July – 2nd February, FY2024
money supply (M2) showed growth of 2.5
percent (Rs 792.3 billion) compared 1.5
percent growth (Rs 426.1 billion) in last
year.
The ﬁrst seven months indicates uptick in
the key economic indicators. It is expected
that the economic activities will gain further
momentum in the last quarter of FY2024.
The positive outlook is contingent on the
sustained implementation of sound and
prudent economic policies to achieve the
set growth targets for the current ﬁscal year.

International
Performance
and Outlook
According to World Economic Outlook
(WEO) January 2024, global growth
estimated at 3.1 percent in 2024 before
rising modestly to 3.2 percent in 2025. The
forecast for 2024 is 0.2 percentage point
higher, compared with October 2023 WEO,
indicating upgrades for China, the United
States, and large emerging market and
developing economies. Nevertheless, the
projection for global growth in 2024 and
2025 is below the historical (2000–19)
annual average of 3.8 percent, reﬂecting
restrictive monetary policies and withdrawal
of ﬁscal support, as well as low underlying
productivity growth. Advanced economies
are expected to observe growth decline
slightly in 2024 before rising in 2025, with a
recovery in the euro area from low growth in
2023 and a moderation of growth in the
United States. Emerging market and
developing economies are expected to
experience stable growth through 2024 and
2025.
Global headline inﬂation is expected to fall
from an estimated 6.8 percent in 2023 to 5.8
percent in 2024 and 4.4 percent in 2025.
The drivers of declining inﬂation differ by
country but generally reﬂect lower core
inﬂation as a result of still-tight monetary
policies, a related softening in labor
markets, and pass-through effects from
earlier and ongoing declines in relative
energy prices.
World trade growth is projected at 3.3
percent in 2024 and 3.6 percent in 2025,
below its historical average growth rate of
4.9 percent. Rising trade distortions and
geo-economic fragmentation are expected
to continue to weigh on the level of global
trade. These forecasts are based on
assumptions that fuel and non-fuel
commodity prices will decline in 2024 and
2025, and interest rates will also be
declining in major economies. Annual

average oil prices are projected to fall by
about 2.3 percent in 2024, whereas non-fuel
commodity prices are expected to fall by 0.9
percent.
The Federal Reserve held its benchmark
overnight interest rate steady in the 5.255.50 percent range at the end of its January
30-31 policy meeting. However, committee
has considered to reducing it once
policymakers are more conﬁdent, inﬂation
will continue falling to the U.S. central
bank's 2 percent target. Upcoming data on
inﬂation, jobs and consumer spending will
shape the timing of that decision. CPI index
rose 3.1 percent on YoY basis in January,
down from 3.4 percent in the prior month,
but the latest inﬂation numbers was higher
than expected projections.
U.S. ﬁrms added 353,000 jobs in January
up from 333,000 jobs in December. The
unemployment rate remained steady at 3.7
percent. The US Commerce Department's
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)
reported fourth quarter real GDP increased
at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in the fourth
quarter of 2023 exceeding expectations. In
addition, the economy added 2.7 million
jobs in 2023.Consumer conﬁdence
continues to remain strong. This also
evident through growth in WEI which is
hovering around 2-2.5 percent in recent
months (Fig-1).
The J. P. Morgan Global Composite Output
Index increased to 51.8 in January 2024 as
against 51.0 in December 2023 and its
highest reading since June 2023. Services
business activity rose at the quickest pace
since July 2023, as increases in the
business and ﬁnancial services categories
offset a minor decrease at consumer
service providers.
Data by nation signaled expansions of
economic output in 09 out of the 14 nations
for which January data were available. The
BRIC nations of Brazil, Russia, India and
China made up four of the top-ﬁve
performers, along with the UK in fourth
position overall. The US, Japan, Italy and
Spain were the other nations to signal
expansions. France, Canada and Germany
were the worst performers overall, while

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

Australia and Kazakhstan also observed
output decline. This growth expansion is
also evident through CLI position of
Pakistan's main export markets. The
expansion has been observed in UK and
China, contrary US and Euro Area
economies are below their potential (Fig-2).
The FAO food prices index (FFPI) averaged
118.0 points in January 2024, down 1.2
points from its revised December level, as
decline in the price indices for cereals and
meat more than offset an increase in the
sugar price index, while those for dairy and
vegetable oils registered slight adjustments.
Energy prices in January increased by 8.2
percent, led by natural gas US (25.9
percent) and oil (2.6 percent). Non-energy
prices eased by 0.7 percent. Food prices
declined by 1.6 percent. Beverage and raw
materials gained 1.7 percent and 0.9
percent. Fertilizer prices plunged 2.9
percent. Metal price inched down 0.3
percent led by nickel (-2.2 percent) and
Iron-Ore (-0.9 percent). Precious metal
eased by 0.3 percent.

Economic
Outlook

Rs

3.1 Inﬂation
In February 2024, the administered prices of
petrol and diesel increased in response to a
notable surge in crude oil prices,
highlighting the direct inﬂuence of global
market dynamics on domestic fuel costs.
Despite the upward adjustment in
transportation expenses and gas prices, the
inﬂation outlook for the upcoming month
may have a downward trend, primarily due
to a decrease in the prices of perishable
items on the back of better crops and ease
in supplies. Additionally, the high base effect
would further contribute to keep the
inﬂationary pressure on the lower side.
Meanwhile, the Food and Agriculture
Organization's food price index, which
tracks the most globally traded food
commodities, averaged 118.0 points in
January 2024 down by 1.0 percent from
December level as decreases in the price
indices for cereals and meat more than
offset an increase in the sugar price index,
while those for dairy and vegetable oils only
registered slight adjustments.
Considering these factors, inﬂation is
projected to hover around 24.5-25.5 percent
in February 2024, with expectations of a
further easing to 23.5-24.5 percent in March
2024.
3.2 Agriculture
The input situation is favorable. Weather is
an important component in achieving the
production targets of Rabi 2023-24. The
PMD's weather outlook for February 2024,
shows that a moderate amount of water
would be available for standing crops and
vegetables having a positive impact on Rabi
crops. Farmers in Barani areas may plan
scheduled watering.
3.3 Industrial activity
The LSM cycle usually follows the cyclical
movements in the main trading partners, but
since it is focused on the main industrial

FEBRUARY - 2024

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

sectors and not on total GDP, it is somewhat
more volatile than the cyclical component of
GDP in Pakistan's main export markets.
The LSM activity since April 2023 followed
an upward trend, aligning with the growth
observed in the output gap of Pakistan's
main export areas. This suggests a positive
momentum in industrial production. Both
have now reached a level above the neutral
benchmark. However, in the case of
Pakistan, volatility remains high, and it is not
excluded that in January 2024, the
seasonally adjusted LSM output may
marginally fall back below its potential. In
this respect, it can be observed that in
January 2024 total cement dispatches
showed a signiﬁcant YoY decline, whereas
the YoY growth rate of total production of all
vehicles also remained subdued.
The LSM activity increased by 3.4 percent
YoY in December 2023 while on MoM it has
witnessed a sharp rise of 15.7 percent in
December 2023 over November 2023. It is
therefore expected that despite challenges
such as volatility and speciﬁc sectoral
slowdown, the positive trend in LSM growth
will continue in the remaining months of the
current ﬁscal year.
3.4 Overall Economic Activity
The Monthly Economic Indicator (MEI) is
developed as a tool to distribute the past
annual GDP numbers, reported by the PBS,
on a monthly/quarterly basis, and to

nowcast GDP growth for the ﬁscal year in
which the National Accounts are not yet
available on the same frequency. The ﬁgure
presents the MEI every month since July
2019. It should be noted that some of the
data underlying the January 2024 MEI are
still provisional and may be revised next
month.
The restrictive stance of monetary policy
and limited ﬁscal space are posing
numerous challenges to stimulating the
economy. Despite the domestic challenges,
there is some optimism regarding Pakistan's
export markets. The weighted average
cyclical conditions in Pakistan's main export
markets are improving which will be
supportive in providing a boost to exportoriented industries and thus overall
economic growth. Despite some important
headwinds, the MEI remains in positive
territory, indicating a gradual recovery in
economic activities.
The economy is beneﬁtting from
stabilization measures leading to restoring
business conﬁdence. The KSE-100 index
started to rebound at the end of 2023 and
has remained at a higher level since then.
The rebound in stock prices is conﬁrmed by
a simultaneous rebound in overall business
conﬁdence. In addition, the stability in the
exchange rate also ensures a conducive
environment for economic growth thus
reducing uncertainty.

3.5 External
During January – 2024, exports of goods
and services increased by 15.8 percent on
YoY basis, due to observed expansion in
domestic economic activities and revived
economic situation in Pakistan's main
exports destinations. However, on MoM
basis it decreased by 4.4 percent, due to
negative seasonal effect in January. On the
other hand, imports of goods and services
increased by 21.3 and 11.0 percent on YoY
and MoM basis respectively. Higher imports
have been reﬂected in the trade deﬁcit of
goods and services, which increased by
31.1 and 48.9 percent on YoY and MoM
basis, respectively. The current account
balance has been partially offset by
remittances – posted signiﬁcant growth of
26.2 percent on YOY basis – despite
negative seasonal effect. Current account
turns to deﬁcit of US$ 269 million in January
- 2024 as compared surplus of US$ 404
million in December – 2023. In the current
baseline scenario, an improvement and
recovery has been expected in exports,
imports and remittances on a monthly basis.
As a result, current account will remain in
manageable limit during remaining months
of FY2024.
3.6 Fiscal
On the revenue side, FBR tax collection has
shown a remarkable performance by
posting a growth of around 30.0 percent
during Jul-Jan FY2024. The actual
collection exceeded the target by Rs 35
billion during the ﬁrst seven months of the

current ﬁscal year. The positive growth
trends in tax collection are indicative of
improving economic conditions, gradual
recovery in business activities, and effective
enforcement measures. Consequently, the
revenue landscape presents a promising
outlook, characterized by substantial growth
across various tax components.
In contrast, higher markup payments are
putting signiﬁcant pressure on expenditures.
However, the government's persistent
efforts to curtail non-markup expenditures
through austerity measures have facilitated
a continuous improvement in primary
surplus. It is therefore expected that the
continuity of ﬁscal consolidation efforts will
support maintaining the ﬁscal deﬁcit within
manageable limits.
3.7 Final Remarks
The inﬂation outlook for the upcoming
month points towards a downward trajectory
owing to better crops and a smooth supply
of commodities. Similarly, favorable input
situations are set to bolster Rabi crop
production. On the other hand, industrial
activity in December remained positive
despite a speciﬁc sectoral slowdown.
Notwithstanding, restrictive monetary and
ﬁscal policies, the optimism is fueled by
improvements in cyclical conditions in
Pakistan's export markets facilitating steady
economic recovery. The stabilization
measures encouraging business conﬁdence
coupled with exchange rate stability,
contribute to a positive economic outlook for
Pakistan amidst ongoing challenges.
