Foreword

Minister for Finance, Revenue
& Economic Affairs

Hard earned gains on the fiscal and
external accounts have started to translate
into a pick-up in economic activity. Markets
have rallied on positive economic data and
signs of an emerging recovery. PSX has
rallied 11% in October and has crossed the
psychological barrier of 51,000 points, for
the first time since May 2017. The
international and domestic bond markets
have rallied around 8% in October on
expectations of ease in inflationary
pressures and a positive expectation for the
IMF staff review in November. The rupee
(PKR) recovered 9% in October due to
reforms initiated on the exchange
companies and crackdown against illegal
transactions.
The Monthly Economic Indicator (MEI) for
Sept 2023 posted the third consecutive
month of positive gains in the index,
reflecting growth momentum in the highfrequency economic variables. GDP growth
outlook has improved with data showing
positive momentum in manufacturing
activity and improved outlook for agriculture
output.
The recent release of LSM data showed
positive growth of 2.5% in August, reversing
14 months of downward spiral in the

manufacturing sector. The removal of
restrictions on imports, clearance of
outstanding L/Cs, and improved dollar
liquidity in the markets following an increase
in SBP FX reserves contributed towards the
pick-up in economic activity.
The recovery in the manufacturing sector is
broad-based with the export sector,
construction activity, and consumer goods
all positing gains in August. Higher output
for Ready-made garments (41.2%) reflects
higher exports and was the main contributor
to LSM. Higher cement (27.6%) production
signifies higher construction-related activity.
Food (8%), beverages (8.4%), and
pharmaceuticals (41.8%) reflect a recovery
in domestic demand. Power Generation
also posted a growth of 7.4% in Q1
FY2024, indicating a recovery in economic
activity from last year.
In the agriculture sector, cotton production
is projected to rise 127% (estimated at 11.5
million bales) for 2023-24, compared to last
year. Rice production is also showing an
impressive growth 18% percent compared
to last year. The increase in these main
crops is encouraging for the exports and
overall economic outlook in FY2024.
Moreover, input situation is positive as farm
tractors production and sales show a steep
growth of 45% percent (11,586) and 64%
percent (12,090), respectively during JulSep FY2024 over the same period last year.
During Q1 FY2024, the strong revenue
performance led to a primary surplus of Rs
417bn (0.4% of GDP) against the target of
Rs 87bn under the IMF SBA. FBR revenues
clocked in at Rs 2,042bn compared to the
target of Rs 1,978bn during Q1, with a
strong 37% y/y increase in direct taxes,
while FED collection increased by 61%y/y.
Similarly, non-tax revenue also posted a
significant increase of 100% in Q1 with
higher collection on Petroleum Levy (PL)
and dividends of SOEs.
On the expenditure side, the primary
concern is the rise in the cost of servicing
public debt, with the rise in SBP policy rates
to 22% and weaker PKR fueling the rise in
servicing costs. Debt servicing costs
increased 45% in Q1 to Rs 1.4 trillion.

Despite this increase, the government
managed to limit growth in expenditures
through a prudent reduction in untargeted
subsidies and a reduction in spending on
new projects and schemes under the PSDP.
While headline inflation has accelerated to
31.4%y/y in Sept 2023 from 27.4% in Aug;
this increase was an anomaly due to the
low base impact as a result of a one-time
power tariff adjustment in Sep-2022. Food
inflation softened to 33%y/y in Sept
compared to 39%y/y in Aug. Major
contributors to the decline were Tomatoes
(14%m/m), Chicken (12%), and cooking oil
(2%).
th

The 30 October MPS states that inflation
will 'decline significantly in October, owing
to downward adjustments in fuel prices,
easing prices of some major food
commodities, and a favorable base effect'.
The MPC 'reaffirmed its earlier assessment
that inflation will decline substantially from
the second half of FY24, barring any major
adverse developments'.
On the external front, the global markets
remain volatile but the global growth outlook
has improved. Global economic growth is
gradually rising, though wide disparities
among regions persist. Some economies
have yet to fully return to pre-pandemic
levels. Factors hindering this recovery
include geopolitical tensions, cyclical
monetary policy adjustments, reduced fiscal
support due to high debt, and extreme
weather events.
In the first three months of the current year,
CAD has declined further by 58% to $ 0.95
bn. The full-year CAD is projected to
stabilize around $ 6.5bn (1.5% of GDP) in
FY2024 as trade & investment flows
normalize. SBP FX reserves have stabilized
at around $ 7.5bn (1.5 months of import
cover). To meet the external financing
requirements, we are working to secure
concessional funding from multilateral (WB,
ADB, IsDB) of US$ 6.3bn, IMF $ 3bn has
already been approved, and bilateral
assistance of around US$ 10bn.
The government expects remittances to
recover in Oct 2023, as spreads between

the interbank and open market have
reduced below 1%. However, global
inflation has impacted the disposable
incomes of overseas workers, resulting in
lower remittances. We note that remittances
have recorded a slowdown across the
board in most countries and in particular
Bangladesh, India, and the Philippines.

Executive
Summary
Global economic growth is gradually
rebounding, though wide disparities among
regions persist. Some economies have yet
to fully return to pre-pandemic levels.
Factors hindering this recovery include
geopolitical tensions, cyclical monetary
policy adjustments, reduced ﬁscal support
due to high debt, and the extreme weather
events.
Pakistan's economy has set the growth
momentum from beginning of the current
ﬁscal year, evident through a notable upturn
in various economic indicators. The recent
release of LSM data showed a positive
growth of 0.5 percent during Jul-Aug
FY2024 against the contraction of 1.3
percent last year. The MoM and YoY basis
growth trajectory is encouraging, as LSM
grew by 8.4% and 2.5% in Aug-2023,
respectively. The positive growth is backed
by recovering sub-sectors which include
Food, Coke & Petroleum Products, Wearing
apparel, Chemicals, Pharmaceuticals,
Rubber Products, Non-Metallic Mineral
Products, Machinery and Equipment, and
others.
In agriculture sector, the Cotton production
showing a bumper increase of 126.6
percent (estimated at 11.5 million bales) for
2023-24, compared to last year. Rice
production is also showing a surge of 18.0
percent compared to last year. The increase
in these main crops is encouraging for the
exports and overall economic outlook in
FY2024. Moreover, input situation is positive
as farm tractors production and sales show
a steep growth of 45.0 percent (11,586) and
64.1 percent (12,090), respectively during

Jul-Sep FY2024 over the same period last
year.
On the external front, FDI reached $ 402.3
million during Jul-Sep FY2024 ($ 349.8
million last year) increased by 15.0 percent
on account of some Chinese investment in
the CPEC related projects. The MoM
Exports increased by 1.5 percent to $ 2.5
billion in September 2023 as compared to $
2.4 billion in August 2023. The rebounded
economic activity in major trading partners
coupled with relaxed import restrictions, is
mitigating disruptions in the supply of raw
materials and supporting export-oriented
industries. The narrower trade balance is
supporting the current account which has
recorded a deﬁcit of $ 947 million for JulSep FY2024 as against a deﬁcit of $ 2.3
billion last year. Workers' remittances stood
at $ 6.3 billion ($ 7.9 billion last year)
posting a decrease by 19.8 percent during
the period under review. However, on MoM
basis, it increased by 5.3 percent mainly on
account of shrinking wedge between interbank and open market excgange rate.
During Jul-Aug FY2024, the performance of
the ﬁscal sector remained satisfactory owing
to a signiﬁcant rise in revenues relative to
expenditures. Although higher markup
payments continued to be the major source
of increase in current expenditures, but
growth in non-mark-up spending was
restricted to 7.4 percent. The ﬁscal deﬁcit
stood at almost the same level of 0.8
percent of GDP as last year whereas the
primary balance posted a surplus of Rs
144.8 billion against the deﬁcit of Rs 90.2
billion during the period under review.
CPI inﬂation stood at 31.4 percent on a YoY
basis in September 2023 as compared to
23.2 percent in September 2022. The major
drivers include Food and non-alcoholic
beverages, Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas
& Fuel, Transport and Furnishing &
household equipment maintenance.

th

During 1 July – 30 September, FY2024
money supply shows negative growth of
0.02 percent compared to negative growth
of 0.012 percent during the same period last
year. This is due to decline in NDA of
banking sector.

The government is pursuing economic
revival measures to improve the near-term
economic situation and taking policy,
administrative, and relief intervensions in
order to control inﬂationary pressure in
FY2024.

International
Performance
and Outlook
The global economic recovery from the
COVID-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine
remains slow and uneven. Economic activity
have not yet fully rebounded to prepandemic level in several economies.
According to World Economic Outlook
(October-2023), global growth is forecasted
to slow from 3.5 percent in 2022 to 3.0
percent in 2023 and 2.9 percent in 2024.
The projections remain below the historical
(2000–2019) average of 3.8 percent. For
advanced economies, the expected
slowdown is from 2.6 percent in 2022 to 1.5
percent in 2023 and 1.4 percent in 2024,
amid stronger-than-expected US
momentum but weaker-than-expected
growth in the euro area. Emerging market
and developing economies are projected to
have growth modestly declined, from 4.1
percent in 2022 to 4.0 percent in both 2023
and 2024, reﬂecting the property sector
crisis in China. The global growth over the
medium term is projected at 3.1 percent
which is the lowest in decades.
China's growth momentum is fading
following a COVID-19 reopening surge in
early 2023. Growth slowed from 8.9 percent
in the ﬁrst quarter of 2023 to 4.0 percent in
the second quarter. High-frequency
indicators suggest further weakness with
the property sector crisis in the country as
the leading factor hampering growth.
Commodity exporter countries that are part
of the Asian industrial supply chain are the
most exposed to China's loss of
momentum.
Growth in the euro area is projected to fall
from 3.3 percent in 2022 to 0.7 percent in

OCTOBER - 2023

2023, before rising to 1.2 percent in 2024.
Among other major advanced economies,
growth in the UK is projected to decline from
4.1 percent in 2022 to 0.5 percent in 2023
and 0.6 percent in 2024. The decline in
growth reﬂects tighter monetary policies to
curb still-high inﬂation and lingering impacts
of the terms-of-trade shock from high
energy prices.
Global inﬂation is forecasted to decline
steadily, from 8.7 percent in 2022 to 6.9
percent in 2023 and 5.8 percent in 2024.
However, forecasts for 2023 and 2024 are
revised up by 0.1 and 0.6 percentage point,
respectively. Consequenctly, inﬂation is not
expected to return to the target until 2025 in
many economies.
In the United States, growth is projected at
2.1 percent in 2023 (same as 2022) and 1.5
percent in 2024. The forecast is revised
upward, owing to stronger business
investment in the second quarter and
resilient consumption growth, a reﬂection of
a still-tight labor market. Policymakers
foresee the economy's resilience combined
with high inﬂation may trigger the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates again in
November. Others, however, expect the
darkening cloud over the economy would
discourage the US central bank from
tightening monetary policy further. The
situation is also evident through growth in
WEI which is hovering around 1-2 percent in
the month of September (Fig-1).

Global economic growth remained
lacklustre at the end of the third quarter of
2023, as output edged higher and intakes of
new work contracted in Sep-2023. There
were also signs of further weakness in the
coming months, as backlogs of work fell
sharply and business optimism dipped to a
nine-month low. The J.P.Morgan Global
Composite PMI Output Index – fell to 50.5
in September, down from 50.6 in August, on
account of contraction in manufacturing
activity. The month of September also
observed signs of slowdown in the global
services sector.
PMI data is available for 13 economies, of
which 08 have witnessed an overall output
increase. Russia and Kazakhstan were at
the top of the growth rankings, while Japan,
China and the US also posted expansions.
Weakness was largely centred on the euro
area, where output fell for the fourth
successive month. Germany and France
were at the bottom of the PMI rankings. The
UK, Italy and Brazil were the other nations
to register declines. The monthly output
movement is also reﬂected through CLI
position of Pakistan's main trading partners,
of which euro area countries and US
moving below potential level (Fig-2).
The overall measure of international food
commodity prices, FAO Food Prices Index
(FFPI) was broadly stable in September,
averaged 121.5 points compared to 121.4
points in August. The index has been
declined by 10.7 percent on YoY basis and
24.0 percent below its all-time high in
March, 2022. In September, decline in
prices of vegetable oils (3.9%), wheat
(1.6%), Rice (0.5%), dairy (2.3%) and meat
(1.0%) offset by a notable increase in sugar
(9.8%) and maize (7.0%).
Global commodity prices surged YoY in
September, 2023 . Energy prices increased
by 8.3 percent, led by oil (9.1%) and coal
Australia (6.5%). Non-energy prices
increased by 1.5 percent. Food prices
increased by 2.0 percent. Beverage gained
by 1.1 percent while raw materials and
fertilizers prices change little. Metal price
rose 1.5 percent led by iron ore (9.8%).
Whereas precious metal dropped by 0.3
percent.

In Jul-Sep FY2024, the performance of
auto-industry remains subdued due to
massive increase in input prices, and
tightening auto ﬁnance. Car production and
sale decreased by 49.1 percent and 43.9
percent, while Trucks & Buses production
and sale decreased by 59.0 percent and
44.9 percent, respectively.
The sale of petroleum products slumped by
16 percent during Jul-Sep FY2024 to 3.77
mn tons against 4.49 mn tons in the same

2.3 Fiscal
The net federal revenues witnessed a
substantial increase of 54.7 percent surging
to Rs 816.6 billion during Jul-Aug FY2024
from Rs 527.8 billion last year. The revenue
performance has been largely attributed to a
sharp rise in non-tax collection which
escalated from Rs 111.1 billion during JulAug FY2023 to Rs 282.8 billion during JulAug FY2024. Higher receipts from
petroleum levy, markup (PSEs and others),

remarkable performance by FBR, as the
total collection not only grew by 24.9
percent but also surpassed the target by Rs
64.0 billion. The provisional net collection
amounted to Rs 2041.5 billion during JulSep FY2024 against Rs 1633.9 billion last
year. Similarly, in the month of September
2023, tax collection exceeded the target by
Rs 40.0 billion to reach Rs 834.1 billion

2.5 External Sector

Total expenditures grew by 20.1 percent to
Rs 1585.7 billion during Jul-Aug FY2024
against Rs 1320.2 billion last year. The
growth in expenditures primarily stemmed
from a 38.6 percent increase in current
spending which stood at Rs 1450.0 billion in
Jul-Aug FY2024 against Rs 1046.2 billion
last year. Higher markup payments
continued to be the major source of
increase in current expenditures, as it grew
by 63.5 percent during Jul-Aug FY2024. In
contrast, the growth in non-markup
spending has been restricted to 7.4 percent.
Overall, the ﬁscal deﬁcit stood at almost the
same level of 0.8 percent of GDP in Jul-Aug
FY2024 as observed last year. However, the
primary balance remained in surplus of Rs
144.8 billion against the deﬁcit of Rs 90.2

3.1 Inflation
The international food price trends, as
reported by the FAO, indicate a relatively
stable situation in September 2023. While
certain food categories, like vegetable oils,
dairy and meat prices witnessed decline,
while others, including sugar and cereals,
recorded increase. However, these
ﬂuctuations balanced out, resulting in an
overall index value of 121.5 points, nearly
identical to August 2023.
On the domestic front, the government has
slashed the petrol and diesel prices
consecutively in two instances, capitalizing
on declining global crude rates and a
stronger domestic currency. These
developments are expected to mitigate the
inﬂationary pressures in the country.
Moreover, the subsequent efforts of the subnational governments to implement lower
fares of local public and freight
transportation, in line with the reduced fuel
prices, would further relieve stress on
consumer prices.
Taking these factors into account, it is
anticipated that inﬂation will be better
contained compared to the elevated levels
observed in the ﬁrst quarter of FY2024. The
projection of inﬂation is hovering around 27
to 29 percent for October 2023.

31.66 MAF of water but prevailing weather
conditions are conducive and the shortage
is manageable.

3.3 Industrial activity
The LSM cycle usually follows the cyclical
movements in the main trading partners, but
since it is focused on the main industrial
sectors and not on total GDP, it is somewhat
more volatile than the cyclical component of
GDP in Pakistan's main export markets. The
aggregate CLI in the main export markets
slightly has improved but still below the
potential level. The cyclical LSM pattern for
the month of August came out above its
stochastic trend. For September, LSM
growth may converge to its potential if the
overall economic situation continues to
improve in coming months.

3.4 Overall Economic Activity

To improve food security situation in the
country, the government is facilitating the
farmers by providing inputs at affordable
prices and ensuring better price of their
produce to bridge the gap between cost of
production and output price. For Rabi crops
2023-24, the outlook is positive as the seed
availability will remain satisfactory and
supply of urea and DAP expected to remain
stable (Nov-Dec, 2023). However, the water
availability is anticipated to be short by 15
percent for Punjab & Sindh during the
season. Provinces have been allocated

The Monthly Economic Indicator (MEI) is
developed as a tool to distribute the past
annual GDP numbers, reported by the PBS,
on a monthly/quarterly basis, and to
nowcast GDP growth for the FY in which the
National Accounts are not yet available on
the same frequency. Figure presents the
MEI on a monthly basis since January 2019.
It should be noted that some of the data
underlying the September 2023 MEI are still
provisional and may be revised next month.
The MEI estimated for the month of

September 2023 stood positive on the back
of improved high frequency variables such
as LSM, exports, cement dispatches etc.
MEI is expected to be positive throughout
the outgoing ﬁscal year due to a rebound in
domestic economic activities.

3.5 External
The BoP data for September 2023 reveals
that exports of goods and services
increased marginally by 0.6% on MoM
basis, while imports of goods and services
decreased by 5.9%. In response to this,
trade deﬁcit of goods and services declined
by 15.6% on MoM basis in the month of
September. Moreover, recent administrative
and regulative action for curbing illegal
activities in the FX market has narroweddown the gap between interbank and open
market exchange rates and worker's
remittances increased by 5.3% on MoM
basis. All these components have been
reﬂected in the current account deﬁcit,
which decreased signiﬁcantly by 95.1% on
MoM basis and 97.8% on YoY basis.
For the outlook, it is expected that exports
of goods and services for October 2023 will
remain around $ 3.0 billion as observed in
September and gradually take its increasing
momentum in the coming months as LSM
shows some turning point and posted
growth of 8.4 percent in August on monthly
basis. On the other hand, imports are
showing some ﬂuctuations on monthly basis
and are expected to remain in the range of

$ 4.0 - 4.5 billion in October as PKR is
continuously appreciating against USD.
Taking all these factors into account and
with a positive outlook for remittances, the
current account will continue to observe it's
improved monthly trend.

3.6 Fiscal
The government's commitment to ﬁscal
consolidation efforts is evident through
better ﬁscal accounts during the ﬁrst quarter
of the current ﬁscal year. The ﬁscal outlook
for FY2024 presents encouraging revenue
growth and prudent expenditure
management. The substantial increase in
net federal revenues, primarily driven by a
sharp rise in non-tax collection, indicates a
positive trend in revenue performance.
Similarly, higher-than-expected tax
collection in the ﬁrst quarter of FY2024
highlights the effective implementation of
new tax measures, the moderate revival of
economic activities, and efﬁcient tax
administration.
Whereas, on the expenditure side, higher
markup payments will continue to pose
signiﬁcant challenges for ﬁscal consolidation
efforts. Nonetheless, cautious expenditure
management is paying off in terms of
restricted growth in non-markup spending.
This helped in maintaining the primary
balance in surplus indicating better ﬁscal
management, while the ﬁscal deﬁcit has
remained at a similar level of 0.8 percent of
GDP in Jul-Aug FY2024 compared to the
last year.
The government is highly committed to
achieve long-term ﬁscal sustainability
through prudent ﬁscal management.
Measures are focused on rationalizing
expenditures through austerity measures,
reducing subsidies and grants, no
supplementary grants, increasing revenues
through various policy and administration
measures, widening the tax base, and
removal of tax exemption. These measures
would be helpful in building ﬁscal buffers for
social safety nets together with meeting the
ﬁscal and primary balance targets set for
the current ﬁscal year.

3.7 Final Remarks
The ﬁrst quarter of FY2024 demonstrates
that the economy is yielding positive results
from the development and government
stabilization measures. In real sector of the
economy, Cotton and Rice production for
2023-24 has posted exceptional growth of
126.6 and 18.0 percent, respectively.
Similarly, LSM increased by 2.5 percent on
YoY basis in Aug-23 and on MoM basis, it
bounced back by 8.4 percent against the
decline of 3.7 percent in July. Moreover, the
external account has improved considerably
and foreign exchange buffers are being built
up. At ﬁscal front, the government's
commitment to ﬁscal consolidation efforts

and maintaining ﬁscal discipline is evident
through better ﬁscal accounts during JulAug, FY2024.
In the coming months, it is expected that
overall economic activity will remain positive
throughout the outgoing ﬁscal year due to a
rebound in domestic economic activities and
improvement in inﬂationary pressures.
Moreover, recent coordinated efforts by the
Government organizations to address
macroeconomic imbalances, will gear
towards achieving stabilization in the
coming months and realizing sustainable
and inclusive economic growth in the
medium to long-term.
