Execu ve
Summary

F

Y2023 was a challenging fiscal year,
however, it has witnessed
noteworthy fiscal and current
account balance improvements. The
government's stern decisions and
stabilization measures have steered the
country towards a sustainable path. Growth
targets of 3.5% are anticipated to be met
through Kissan package, industrial support,
export promotion, encouragement of the IT
sector, and resource mobilization efforts.
On the global front, the economic activity in
major advanced economies is still showing
signs of weakness, mainly due to the
continuation of monetary tightening
measures. Inflation has fallen in some
economies due to lower energy prices, but
food and services prices continue to rise,
contributing to persistent high inflation.
Monetary tightening measures are still in
place.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation has
declined to 29.4 percent in the month of
June 2023 from 38.0 percent recorded in
May 2023. The food inflation (urban) has
declined from 48.1 percent to 40.8 percent.
Sensitive price indicator (SPI) also declined
by 0.07 percent on week ended 20th July,
2023.

The fiscal front has seen an important
improvement, with the primary deficit
reducing significantly from Rs. 945.3 billion
last year to Rs. 112.0 billion during Jul-May
FY2023. Furthermore, the fiscal deficit is
also expected to decline from the previous
year 7.9% of GDP, largely due to a 12%
reduction in non-markup spending.
In order to contain persistently rising
inflationary pressures and to maintain
external sector stability, SBP had to
increase the policy rate by 100 basis points
to 22 percent in its last monetary policy
committee meeting.
The current account deficit has also
declined by 85.4 percent as compared to

the last year. The current account has
posted a deficit of $2.6 billion for FY2023, a
reduction from the previous year's deficit of
$17.5 billion. The current account has
improved, resulting in a surplus of $334
million in June 2023.

Interna onal
Performance and
Outlook
OECD economic outlook estimated global
growth to be 2.7% in 2023, with a modest
pick-up to 2.9% in 2024 – both well below
the average growth rate in the decade
preceding the COVID-19 pandemic. Global
GDP growth slowed substantially
throughout 2022, but several of the factors
weighing negatively are now unwinding.
Falling energy prices and headline inflation,
easing supply bottlenecks and the
reopening of China's economy coupled with
strong employment, all contribute to a
projected recovery. Significant uncertainty
about economic prospects remains, and the
major risks to the projections are on the
downside. One key concern is that inflation
could continue to be more persistent than
expected.
Emerging-market economies face
challenges from tight global financial
conditions: higher debt servicing costs,
capital outflows, and reduced credit
availability from foreign lenders. Moreover,
rising geopolitical tensions and concerns
about supply chain security have prompted
several countries to implement trade and
investment restrictions. Increasingly
restrictive trade policies risk curtailing the
gains from global trade and harming the
development prospects of low-income
countries.
Asian Development Outlook for July-2023
projects Developing Asia's outlook
optimistic, as the China reopening and
domestic consumption and investment
continue to underpin growth in the region.
The regional growth forecast is maintained
at 4.8% for 2023 and marginally revised
downward to 4.7% for 2024. It is projected
J U LY 2 0 2 3

that headline inflation is returning to prepandemic averages, as supply-side
pressures from energy and food prices has
been decreased. However, downside risk
also prevails as higher-for-longer interest
rates in the US and other advanced
economies could dent growth prospects.
US economic activity increased slightly in
recent weeks, with slow growth seen
continuing in coming months, according to
Federal Reserve Report “Beige Book”.
Moreover, the report largely dovetailed with
other recent data suggesting upward
pressure on prices was softening. Price
expectations were generally stable or lower
over the next several months. Employment
was also reported to have continued
increasing "modestly". US consumer prices
rose modestly in June by 0.2 percent on
MoM basis and by 3.0 percent on YoY
basis, registered smallest annual increase
since August 2021. In the 12 months
through June, the core CPI rose 4.8%. That
was the smallest YoY gain since October
2021 and followed a 5.3% increase in May.
Nevertheless, inflation remains well above
the Fed's 2% target, with the labor market
still tight. Though employment gains were
the smallest in two and half years in June,
the unemployment rate fell close to
historically low levels and wage growth was
strong, implies Federal Reserve will resume
to raise interest rates this month. The slow
growth economic situation is also reflected
through growth in WEI which is moving
around 1% during second quarter of 2023
compared 3% during same period last year
(Fig-1).
The J. P. Morgan Global Composite Output
Index decreased to 52.7 in June 2023, from
54.4 in May 2023. The global economic
upturn lost momentum at the end of the
second quarter, as a downturn in
manufacturing output was accompanied by
slower growth at service providers. The
expansion continued to be driven by the
service sector as the business, consumer
and financial services remained sluggish.
The major growth was registered in India,
Russia, US and UK all registered growth
above the global average.

The economic situation of Pakistan's major
trading partners also showed through CLI,
of which China, UK and US showing
increasing growth momentum in the month
of June as compared to May, however the
euro area as a whole witnessed growth
below its potential level (Fig-2, page # 2).
The FAO food prices index (FFPI) averaged
122.3 points in June 2023, declined by 1.7
points from May. The decline in June was
driven by a significant decline in the price
indices for vegetable oils, cereals and dairy,
while the meat price index remained
unchanged.
Global commodity prices fell in June 2023.
Energy prices declined by 1.8 percent, led
by coal 13.1 percent and oil 1.2 percent.
Non-energy price fell by 1.9 percent. Food
prices down by 3.5 percent. Fertilizer prices
dropped 9.3 percent. Metal price declined
0.4 percent led by zinc 4.0 percent and

Monthly Performance of Pakistan's
Economy
2.1Real Sector
2.1-a Agriculture
According to the initial estimates, the cotton
area sown in Punjab was recorded at 1.947
million ha which comprises 96.43 percent of
the target (2.019 million ha). Whereas
cotton cultivation area in Sindh stood at
0.625 million ha, 92.98 percent of the target
(0.672 ha). The total sown area stood at
2.676 million ha showing 96.7 percent of
target (2.767 million ha). Further, improved
quality of cotton seed has been used both in
Punjab and Sindh which will auger well to
achieve current year's target of 12.77
million bales.
During Jul-May FY2023, the agriculture
credit disbursement increased by 28.4
percent to Rs 1,565.2 billion as compared to
Rs 1,219.3 billion last year. During May

2023, urea offtake was 459 thousand
tonnes, which increased by 10 percent
while DAP offtake was 66 thousand tonnes,
which decreased by 30.1 per cent over May
2022.

2.1-b Manufacturing
Large Scale Manufacturing remained on a
negative trajectory with the observed
decline of 9.87 percent during Jul-May
Fy2023 due to supply chain disruptions,
inflationary pressures and resultant hikes in
input prices, and continued contractionary
policy stance at the domestic level to
correct the macroeconomic imbalances. On
a YoY basis, LSM nosedived by 14.37
percent in May 2023 and on MoM basis, it
grew by 5.88 percent. During the period, 4
sectors witnessed positive growth which
includes Wearing apparel, Leather
Products, Furniture, and others (Football).
The automobile sector continues to face
challenges due to an unfriendly economic
environment as the total production
witnessed a decline of 37.4 percent in
FY2023 and total sales dipped by 37.8
percent. The poor performance in the Cars,
Tractors and Trucks & Buses remain the
major contributors to the overall decline of
this sector as Car production and sale
decreased by 55.0 percent and 58.7
percent, Tractors production and sale
decreased by 46.1 percent and 47.5
percent, and Trucks & Buses production
and sale decreased by 40.3 percent and
41.0 percent, respectively.

the comparable period of last year.
Net federal revenues grew by 24.4 percent
to Rs.4,166.6 billion in Jul-May FY2023
against Rs 3,349.5 billion last year. The
major contribution in revenues came from a
31 percent increase in non-tax collection on
account of higher collection from petroleum
levy during the period under review.
Besides, other components like markup
(PSEs & others, dividends, passport fees,
royalties on oil/gas, and windfall levy
against crude oil also contributed to
increasing the non-tax collection. In
absolute terms, non-tax revenues increased
to Rs 1,476.1 billion during Jul-May FY2023
from Rs 1,124.1 billion last year.
Net provisional Tax collection, on the other
hand, grew by 16.6 percent to stand at Rs
7,169.1 billion during Jul-Jun FY2023
against Rs 6,148.5 billion last year. Notable,
domestic tax collection surpassed the target
by Rs 102 billion to reach Rs 6,234.3 billion.
It recorded an increase of 21.3 percent
during FY2023 owing to higher collection
from direct tax (43.2 percent), whereas
customs duty reduced by 7.5 percent due to
a significant contraction in imports.
On the expenditure side, total spending
grew by 20 percent to reach Rs 8,849.6
billion during Jul-May FY2023 against Rs
7,361.5 billion last year. Within total, current
expenditure grew by 22 percent to Rs
8,337.8 billion during Jul-May FY2023
against Rs 6,843.8 billion last year. The

J U LY 2 0 2 3

4

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

entire increase in current spending
stemmed from an 80 percent rise in markup
payments owing to a higher policy rate. In
contrast, non-markup spending was
reduced by 12 percent largely due to a 31
percent decline in subsidies and a 32
percent decrease in grants. However, a
notable increase has been witnessed in
grants for BISP and poverty alleviation
funds indicating the government's
commitment to pro-poor spending while
creating fiscal space by reducing nonproductive spending.
With a decline in non-mark-up spending, the
primary deficit has been narrowed down to
Rs.112.0 billion during Jul-May FY2023
from Rs.945.3 billion recorded last year.

2.4 Monetary
Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has
increased the policy rate by 100 bps to 22
percent, effective 27th June, 2023. The
committee considered this action as
necessary to keep real interest rate firmly in
the positive territory on a forward-looking
basis. This would help further anchor
inflation expectations, which are already
moderating over the last few months, and
support bringing down inflation towards the
medium-term target of 5 – 7 percent by the
end of FY25.
During 1st July – 02nd June, FY23 money
supply (M2) shows growth of 8.9 percent
(Rs 2467.5 billion) compared growth of 7.8
percent (Rs 1901.7 billion) in last year.

billion as compared decrease of Rs 1725.7
billion in last year. On the other hand, NDA
of the banking sector increased by Rs
4605.3 billion as compared an increase of
Rs 3627.4 billion last year. Private Sector
has borrowed Rs 25.4 billion as compared
borrowing of Rs 1424.7 billion in last year.

2.5 External Sector

2.6 billion for FY2023 as against a deficit of
$ 17.5 billion last year, mainly due to
contraction in imports. However, the current
account posted a surplus of $ 334 million in
June 2023 as against a deficit of $ 2321
million in same month last year, largely

reflecting an improvement in trade balance.
Exports on fob declined by 14.1 percent
during FY2023 and reached $ 27.9 billion ($
32.5 billion last year). Imports on fob
declined by 27.3 percent during FY2023

phase although still below the potential
except China who successfully entered into
the phase of expansion. Following the CLI,
the cyclical pattern of LSM seems to follow
the cyclical pattern in the main export
markets in the month of May. It is expected
to further improve on a MoM basis,
however, on a YoY basis it is expected to
remain significantly negative on June 2023
due to the high base effect.

3.4 Overall Economic Activity
The Monthly Economic Indicator (MEI) is
developed as a tool to distribute the past
annual GDP numbers, as reported by the
PBS, on a monthly/quarterly basis, and to
nowcast on that same frequency GDP
growth for the FY in which the National
Accounts are not yet available. Fig-7
presents the MEI on a monthly basis since
January 2019. It should be noted that some
of the data underlying the June MEI are still
provisional and may be revised next month.
The MEI calculated for July-22 to June-23 is
well aligned to the newly published national
accounts for FY2023. It indicates that since
April, MEI, following upward trend, is
showing the signs of improvement and is
expected to be positive in the coming
months.

3.5 External
Amid the domestic and global scenarios,
exports of goods and services as per BOP
data in the month of June are on decreasing
trend, which declined by 16.0% and 29% on
MoM and YoY basis, respectively. Similarly,
declining global commodity prices and
contained domestic economic activities
reflected in import numbers, decreased by
17.7% and 54.9% on MoM and YoY basis,
respectively. This is also reflected in
contained trade deficit for goods and
services. Despite the decline in workers'
remittances, significant decline in trade
deficit reflected in surplus of current account
for last two quarters of FY2023.
For FY2024, it is expected that both exports
and imports will gradually increase in
coming months. Taking other factors into
account, the current account deficit will
remain in sustainable limit in FY2024.

3.6 Fiscal
Despite a substantial decline in imports,
LSM, and the overall slowdown in economic
activity, the government's effective resource
mobilization strategy remained effective in
maintaining FBR tax collection growth at
16.6 percent, while non-tax grew by 31
percent. Similarly, on the expenditure side,
though mounting interest expenditure
remained a significant burden on fiscal
accounts, curtailing non-interest spending
triggered a primary deficit to narrow down.
For FY2024, the government is taking
various measures for domestic resource
mobilization. The government has unveiled
a comprehensive strategy for every sector
of the economy in an effort to revive
economic growth and move towards a
higher inclusive and sustainable growth
trajectory. Further different administrative
and policy measures have been introduced
to increase the tax collection. Additionally,
SBP's withdrawal of restrictions on imports
will create demand for imports. All these
measures will be supportive in improving
the revenues. On the expenditure side,
various austerity measures are in place that
will be helpful in reducing non-productive
expenditures.

3.7 Final Remarks
FY2023, a challenging year has ended. The
government succeeded in ensuring the
sustainability of the external and fiscal
sectors through various tough decisions and
stabilization measures. In FY2024, the
government is gearing towards achieving
higher growth of 3.5% through various
measures like the Kissan package,
industrial support, export promotion,
encouragement of the IT sector, and
resource mobilization, etc.

To achieve higher and sustainable
economic growth, it will require prudent and
effective economic decisions, political and
economic certainty, and continuation of
friendly economic policies along with
enough foreign exchange financing. The
recent IMF approval of the Stand- By
Arrangement and other bilateral and
multilateral inflows will pave the way to
further improve the macroeconomic
environment and the confidence of
economic agents.
