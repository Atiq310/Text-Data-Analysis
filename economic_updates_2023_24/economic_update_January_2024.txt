Executive
Summary

I

n first half of FY2024, macroeconomic
conditions have gradually improved,
leading to a revival in overall economic
activity compared to the challenging
FY2023. This persistent uptick in economic
indicators has resulted in improved GDP
growth of 2.13% in the first quarter of
FY2024, with expectations for continued
growth in the second quarter. Business
confidence and the investment climate are
gradually improving, as reflected in the
exceptional performance of the Pakistan
Stock Exchange (PSX) and a steep surge in
FDI. The continual rise in these indicators is
a testament to the strengthening health of
the economy and suggests a positive
economic outlook for the latter half of
FY2024.
The real sector's indicators are largely
showing positive trends. In agriculture
sector, Wheat cultivation have exceeded the
target by 1.8 percent in the Rabi season of
2023-24, aiming for a production of 32.12
million tonnes. This increase is attributed to
favorable climatic conditions and effective
government interventions including
improved seed availability, agricultural
credit, machinery, and fertilizers. During JulDec FY2024, significant growth was
observed in farm tractor production and
sales, with increases of 67.5 percent and
103.3 percent respectively. Agricultural

credit disbursement also increased by 28.5
percent, reaching Rs 853.0 billion. However,
there was a mixed trend in fertilizer usage,
with Urea offtake decreasing by 8 percent
and DAP offtake increasing by 23.7 percent
compared to the previous Rabi season.
The LSM sector is also on a recovery path.
In November 2023, LSM increased by 1.6
percent on a YoY basis and 3.6 percent on
a MoM basis. However, it declined by 0.8
percent during July-November FY2024,
compared to a contraction of 2.3 percent in
the same period last year. At the sub-sector
level, 12 out of 22 sectors experienced
positive growth, including Food, Beverages,
Wearing Apparel, Leather, Coke &
Petroleum Products, Chemicals,
Pharmaceuticals, Non-Metallic Mineral
Products, Rubber Products, Wood
Products, Machinery and Equipment, and
Others (Football). In contrast, negative
growth was observed in Tobacco, Textiles,
Paper & Board, Iron & Steel Products,
Fabricated Metal, Computers, Electronics &
Optical Products, Automobiles, Electrical
Equipment, Furniture, and Other Transport
Equipment.
During Jul-Dec FY 2024, CPI stood at 28.8
percent against 25.0 percent in the same
period last year. On MoM basis, it increased
to 0.8 percent in December 2023 compared
to an increase of 2.7 percent in the previous
month. The major drivers include Food and
non-alcoholic beverages, Housing, water,
electricity, gas & fuel, Transport and
Furnishing & household equipment
maintenance.
On the fiscal front, despite encouraging
revenue performance, the expenditure side
is under pressure attributed to higher mark
up payments. However, government
measures to control non-mark up spending
helped in improving the primary surplus
during the first six months of FY2024. The
overall fiscal deficit has been widened by
2.3 percent of GDP, while the primary
surplus improved by 1.7 percent of GDP
during Jul-Dec FY2024. A surge of 46
percent was observed in revenue collection,
fueled by a 109 percent increase in non-tax
collection while a 30 percent rise in tax

revenues. Although the high markup
payments challenge continued, austerity
measures are being implemented to ensure
sustainable fiscal accounts by the end of
FY2024.
On the external front, during Jul-Dec
FY2024, the current account deficit stood at
$831 million, a marked improvement from
the $3.6 billion deficit of the previous year,
largely due to a better trade balance. In
December 2023, the current account
recorded a surplus of $397 billion, and for
the second quarter of FY2024, it showed a
surplus of $198 million. YoY, exports rose by
21.3 percent, attributed to the easing of
import restrictions which facilitated a steady
supply of raw materials for export-oriented
industries. YoY imports were reduced by 3.6
percent to $4.09 billion in December 2023,
down from $4.24 billion in the same month
the previous year. The trade deficit
narrowed by 3.6 percent to $1.3 billion in
December 2023, compared to $1.9 billion in
the same period last year
FDI reached $ 862.6 million during Jul-Dec
FY2024 ($ 640.0 million last year) increased
by 34.8 percent on account of Chinese
investment. A positive trend was also
observed in remittance which increased by
13.4 percent in December 2023 ($ 2.4
billion) as compared to December 2022 ($
2.1 billion). MoM remittances increased by
5.4 percent owing to structural reforms
related to exchange companies and
consequent convergence of exchange rate
in interbank and open markets.

This positive outlook is contingent on the
sustained implementation of sound and
prudent economic policies, and stability
both on domestic and external fronts.

International
Performance
and Outlook
Global growth is expected to slow further in
2024, amid the lagged and ongoing effects
of tight monetary policies, restrictive
financial conditions, and weak global trade
and investment. Downside risks to the
outlook include an escalation of the recent
conflict in the Middle East and associated
commodity market disruptions, financial
stress amid elevated debt and high
borrowing costs, persistent inflation,
weaker-than-expected activity in China,
trade fragmentation, and climate-related
disasters. According to World Bank's
Global Economic Prospects (GEP)- January
2024, global growth is expected to slow
from 2.6 percent in 2023 to 2.4 percent in
2024 - before ticking up to 2.7 percent in
2025. The forecasts in GEP imply that most
economies - advanced as well as
developing - are set to grow slower in 2024
and 2025 than they did in the decade before
COVID-19.

The market sentiments and business
confidence remained stable. The
performance of Pakistan Stock Exchange
(PSX) remained positive in December 2023.
The benchmark KSE-100 index gained
1,924 points closed at 62,451 points as of
29th December 2023. While market
capitalization of PSX increased by Rs 334
billion and settled at Rs 9,063 billion as of
end December 2023.

While the forecasts in this report are
gloomy, its policy analysis provides hope.
Amid a barrage of shocks during the past
four years, the global economy has proved
to be surprisingly resilient. Major economies
are emerging mostly unscathed after the
fastest rise in interest rates in 40 years without the standard marks of steep
unemployment rates or financial crashes.
Global inflation is being tamed without
tipping the world into a recession.

The first half of the current fiscal year
concluded with stabilizing overall economic
indicators. Looking ahead, it is anticipated
that economic activities will gain further
momentum in the second half of FY2024.

In December 2023, US inflation outstripped
forecasts (3.2 percent), hitting 3.4 percent
on an annual basis (3.1 percent in
November 2023 and 6.5 percent in
December 2022), dimming market

expectations that interest rates would fall as
soon as March. The core rate also came in
higher than expectations, in a clear
vindication of the Federal Reserve's caution
over cutting rates from their 23 year high.
Core inflation recorded at 3.9 percent in
Dec 2023 down from 5.7 percent in Dec
2022. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
reported that the U.S. economy added
216,000 jobs in December - unemployment
held at 3.7%, signaling a strong labor
market. However, the core personal
consumption expenditure (PCE) index,
Fed's preferred inflation gauge - rose just
0.1 percent in November to 3.2 percent
against expectations of 3.3 percent. On a
six-month basis, core PCE was up 1.9
percent, below the Fed's 12-month target. It
is expected that December PCE number will
be released before the upcoming Fed's
Monetary Policy Decision scheduled by the
end of this month. The recently published
GEP revised US growth forecast upward by
1.4 percentage points from its earlier
forecast in June, to 2.5 percent for 2023.
This recovery also reflected through growth
in WEI (Fig-1).

manufacturing output contracted for a
seventh straight month. This moderate
growth trend is also evident through CLI
position of Pakistan's main export markets.
The expansion has been observed in UK
and China whereas US and Euro Area
economies are below their potential (Fig-2).

The global economic expansion accelerated
in December. The J.P.Morgan Global PMI
Composite Output Index - produced by S&P
Global - rose to 51.0 in December, up from
50.5 in November. The headline PMI
remains well below the survey's long-run
average of 53.2. Growth in activity remained
exclusive to the service sector, as

The FAO Food Price Index (FFPI) stood at
118.5 points in December 2023, down 1.8
points (1.5 percent) from its November
level, as decreases in the price indices for
sugar, vegetable oils and meat more than
offset increases in dairy products and
cereals. The index stood 10.1 percent
below on YoY basis in Dec-23 and 13.7
percent lower in the year 2023.
Global commodity prices plummeted in

million hectares which has surpassed the
sowing target of 8.998 million hectares by
1.8 percent to achieve the production target
of 32.12 million tonnes. The Rabi season
crops production is expected to increase
given the climatic condition in the country.
The farm inputs utilization paced well due to
government interventions to boost
agriculture productivity regarding availability
of improved seeds, agricultural credit, farm
machinery and fertilizers. During Jul-Dec
FY2024, farm tractor production and sales
increased by 67.5 percent to 23,610 and
103.3 percent to 23,411, respectively, over
the same period last year. During Jul-Dec
FY2024, the agriculture credit disbursement
reached to Rs 1105.8 billion as compared to

Products, Chemicals, Pharmaceuticals,
Non-Metallic Mineral Products, Rubber
Products, Wood Products, Machinery and
Equipment, and others (Football).
In Jul-Dec FY2024, the performance of
auto-industry remained subdued due to
massive increase in inputs prices, and
tightened auto finance. Car production and
sale decreased by 56.9 percent and 55.5
percent, respectively, while Trucks & Buses
production and sale decreased by 56.9
percent and 49.6 percent. However,

significantly by 110.66 percent, totaling
3.653 million tonnes.

2.2 Inﬂation
CPI inflation recorded at 29.7 percent on a
YoY basis in December 2023 as compared
to 24.5 percent in December 2022. During
Jul-Dec FY 2024, CPI stood at 28.8 percent
against 25.0 percent in the same period last
year. On a MoM basis, it increased to 0.8
percent compared to an increase of 2.7
percent in the previous month.
Major contributors to the YoY increase in
CPI include Alcoholic Beverages & Tobacco

equipment maintenance (32.5 percent),
Housing, Water, Electricity, gas & Fuel (37.7
percent), non-perishable food items (28.7

2.3 Fiscal
The consolidated fiscal deficit has been
recorded at 2.3 percent of GDP (Rs.2407.8
billion) in Jul-Dec FY2024 against 2.0
percent of GDP (Rs.1683.5 billion) last year.
While a primary surplus witnessed a
continuous improvement due to contained
growth in non-mark-up spending relative to
markup payments. Primary surplus
improved to Rs.1812.2 billion (1.7 percent
of GDP) during Jul-Dec FY2024 from the
surplus of Rs.889.6 billion (1.1 percent of
GDP last year.

Total revenues during Jul-Dec FY2024 grew
by 46 percent to reach Rs.6854.0 billion from
Rs.4698.9 billion last year. This notable
performance is driven by a substantial
increase in non-tax collections by 109
percent, reaching Rs.2019.7 billion, and a 30
percent growth in FBR tax collections,
amounting to Rs.4469.2 billion during JulDec FY2024. The sharp rise in non-tax
collection is largely attributed to higher
receipts from mark up (PSEs & others), SBP
profit, and petroleum levy.
FBR tax collection increased by 30 percent to
Rs 4469.2 billion during Jul-Dec FY2024
against Rs 3428.8 billion last year. Notably,
FBR exceeded the assigned target by Rs.44
billion during this period. Within total FBR tax

Economic
Outlook

3.1 Inﬂation
The elevated prices of perishables and
vegetables, coupled with increased utility
costs (electricity and gas), have contributed
to the inflationary pressure. The surge in
onion export orders following the Indian ban
has strained local supply and increased
domestic prices. Specific commodities, such
as tomatoes, witnessed price hikes due to
supply disruptions caused by severe
weather, intensifying the demand-supply
gap. Similarly, chicken prices rose due to
reduced supply, particularly from controlled
sheds experiencing higher input costs.
However, the government has taken

JANUARY - 2024

7

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

measures to reduce onion export by
increasing the minimum export price and
also lifted the ban on soyabean import
which would ease the supply situation of
perishables and chicken.
In January FY2024, there is a slight
moderation in the inflation outlook
compared to the preceding month. Though,
yet, challenges persist in the form of supply
chain disruptions and increased utility
prices, the decline in fuel cost offers a
promising counterbalance, potentially
mitigating the overall impact on consumers
and production sectors.
The Food and Agriculture Organization's
food price index, which tracks the most
globally traded food commodities, averaged
118.5 points in December, 2023 down by
1.5 percent from November level as
decreases in the price indices for sugar,
vegetable oils and meat more than offset
increases in dairy products and cereals.
Keeping in view the above coupled with the
high base effect, inflation is anticipated to
remain around 27.5-28.5 percent in January
2024 and further ease out to 26.5-27.5
percent in February 2024.

3.2 Agriculture
The performance of agriculture sector is
depicting an uptick compared to last year as
crops have performed well. Wheat being the
major crop of Rabi 2023-24 is expected to
perform well as cultivation surpassed the
target.
On the downside unprecedented weather
shocks may affect productivity as January
2024 is the coldest and important month for
the early growth of Rabi crops in most of the
agricultural plains of the country. Farmers
may take precautionary measures to protect
their crops, vegetables, orchids and
livestock from the harmful impacts of
expected extremely cold weather
conditions.

3.3 Industrial activity
The LSM cycle usually follows the cyclical
movements in main trading partners, but
since it is focused on major industrial
sectors and not on total GDP, it is

somewhat more volatile than the cyclical
component of GDP in Pakistan's main
export markets. The economic conditions in
Pakistan's major export destinations have
shown signs of improvement, as evidenced
by the aggregate CLI in those markets. It
has improved and reached its potential level
signaling a favourable external environment
that supports the industrial performance of
Pakistan.
At the domestic level, despite persistent
challenges, the industrial sector is showing
signs of recovery and government
measures to stimulate growth, particularly in
SMEs, are providing impetus. This is
evidenced by the MoM 3.63 percent growth
in the LSM during November 2023, and YoY
increase of 1.59 percent. Similarly, the
revival of industrial sector activities is visible
in the cyclical LSM pattern for the month of
November which has reached the potential
level. Now the main challenge is not only to
improve the cyclical situation but also to
increase potential output through
stimulating investments that lead to capacity
extension in the economy and the industrial
sector. To address this challenge, the
government is implementing effective
measures across all sectors to create a
conducive economic environment which in
turn is expected to attract investments,
fostering sustainable economic growth in
these sectors.

3.4 Overall Economic Activity
The Monthly Economic Indicator (MEI) is
developed as a tool to distribute the past
annual GDP numbers, reported by the PBS,
on a monthly as well as quarterly basis, and
to nowcast GDP growth for the FY in which
the National Accounts are not yet available
on the same frequency. The figure presents
the MEI every month since July 2019. It
should be noted that some of the data
underlying the December 2023 MEI are still
provisional and may be revised next month.
The government's effective measures
helped stabilize the macroeconomic
situation, leading to a gradual improvement
in economic activities. It is apparent from
better growth prospects in the real sector
visible in MoM increase in LSM growth, an
improvement in high-frequency indicators
(cement dispatches, farm tractors,
fertilizers), and an increase in credit
disbursements to the agriculture sector.
Going forward, it is expected that economic
activities will further strengthen during the
second half of the current fiscal year.

3.5 External
December 2023, BoP data shows
momentum of external sector stability as
evident through current account which turns
to a surplus of $ 397 million, the surplus
value observed after June 2023. This
development is mainly due to the contained
trade deficit - which decreased by 25.5 and
23.5 percent on MoM and YoY basis,

respectively on the exports front, it
increased significantly by 14.1 percent on
YoY basis and 5.1 percent on MoM basis.
The upward trend has been observed on
account of revived domestic economic
activities and better export demand in
Pakistan's main export markets. On the
other hand, imports have been contained by
6.1 and 0.1 percent, on MoM and YoY
basis, respectively. Another contributing
factor in current account surplus is workers
remittances – posted expansion of 5.4 and
13.4 percent on MoM and YoY basis,
respectively. The revival in domestic
economic activities along with stable
exchange rate are contributing to external
sector stability. It is expected that
continuation of these developments and
policies to increase exports and remittances
will further translate into improved trade
balance and current account during the
second half of FY2024.

3.6 Fiscal
During the first six months of the current
fiscal year, the consolidation measures
helped in improving the revenues relative to
expenditure. There is a consistent upswing
in revenue collection from both tax and nontax collection. Particularly, tax revenue
performance shows the efficacy of both tax
policy and administrative measures. With
the current pace of tax collection, FBR is
poised to achieve the set target of tax
collection by the end of the current fiscal
year. The significant challenge is higher
markup payments due to the high policy
rate leading to a sharp rise in current
expenditures. To address this challenge, the
government is putting all its efforts into
controlling non-markup spending through
austerity measures which is evidenced by
the rise in primary surplus during Jul-Dec
FY2024. However, due to mounting markup
payments in response to high policy rates,
the expenditure is expected to remain under
pressure during the current fiscal year.

3.7 Final Remarks
The first half of FY2024 has ended with
economic stabilization. The government's
effective measures and prudent policies
helped stabilize the macroeconomic

situation, leading to a gradual improvement
in economic activities. It is apparent from
better growth prospects in the real sector
visible in MoM increase in LSM growth, an
improvement in high-frequency indicators
and better crop prospects. Despite the
challenges, external stability has been
observed as evident from a surplus in the
current account in December. On the fiscal
side, the revenue performance is
encouraging, however, there is significant
pressure on expenditures attributed to
higher markup payments. Despite this, the
government is taking measures to manage
non-markup spending, which is evidenced
by continuous improvement in primary
surplus.

Pakistan has recently received a tranche
equivalent to US$ 705.6 million, following
the successful completion of the first review
by the Executive Board of IMF under Stand
by Arrangements (SBA) – which is providing
market confidence and exchange rate
stability.
For the outlook, it is expected that economic
activities will further strengthen during
second half of FY2024 - contingent on the
continuation of sound and prudent
economic policies which will gear toward
achieving the set growth target for the
current fiscal year.
