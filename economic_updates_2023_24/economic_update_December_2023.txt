Executive
Summary

T

he economic recovery process
continues at a steady pace,
bolstering business conﬁdence and
market sentiment. In November 2023, the
Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) showcased
outstanding performance. The sustained
rise in the PSX index over the past ﬁve
months indicates an improvement in the
overall health of the economy and signals a
positive economic outlook for the ongoing
ﬁscal year.
The real sector is experiencing mixed
performance across the economic sectors.
In agriculture sector, the prospects for
achieving production targets are positive.
During the Rabi season of 2023-24, wheat
cultivation nearly met its planned area.
Notably, Punjab exceeded its wheat sowing
target by 2 percent. Farm inputs have also
observed an upward trend. Farm tractor
production and sales exhibited growth of
60.7 percent and 98.2 percent, respectively,
during Jul-Nov FY2024, compared to the
corresponding period last year. Similarly,
during Oct-Nov 2023, there was a 5.6
percent increase in Urea and a 42 percent
increase in DAP offtake compared to the
same period last year, indicating positive
growth in Rabi crops.
However, LSM sector demonstrated a minor
negative growth of 0.4 percent during Jul-

Oct FY2024, compared to the contraction of
1.7 percent in the previous year. A mixed
trend was observed at the sub-sector level:
12 out of 22 sectors witnessed positive
growth which include, Food, Beverages,
Coke & Petroleum Products, Wearing
apparel, Leather, Chemicals,
Pharmaceuticals, Non-Metallic Mineral
Products, Rubber Products, Fabricated
Metals, Machinery and Equipment, and
others (Football) while Tobacco, Textile,
Wood Products, Paper & Board, Iron &
Steel products, Computer, electronics &
optical products, Automobiles, Electrical
Equipment, Furniture, and Other Transport
Equipment witnessed negative growth.
In November 2023, the CPI inﬂation
recorded at 29.2 percent on YoY basis, up
from 23.8 percent in November 2022. The
major contributors to this rise include food
and non-alcoholic beverages, housing,
water, electricity, gas and fuel, transport,
and the maintenance of furnishings and
household equipment.
Fiscal side highlights the successful
implementation of consolidation measures
in the ﬁrst four months of FY2024, leading
to a signiﬁcant rise in total revenue receipts
that outpaced the growth in expenditures.
Consequently, the ﬁscal deﬁcit has been
curtailed to 0.8 percent of GDP, and the
primary surplus has improved to Rs.1429.7
billion during Jul-Oct FY2024.
On the external front, the global economic
growth is expected to improve in 2023,
largely due to increased consumer spending
in China and accelerated growth in the U.S.
This positive change has helped mitigate
the signiﬁcant slowdown that Europe
experienced in 2022, caused by an energy
crisis.
The external sector indicators show a strong
recovery during Jul-Nov FY2024. YoY
exports increased by 21.5 percent in
November 2023 whereas imports increased
by 2.9 percent. This increase is attributed to
eased import restrictions, resulting in a
smoother supply of raw materials for exportoriented industries. Based on the improved
trade balance, the Current Account posted a
deﬁcit of $1.16 billion for Jul-Nov FY2024, in

DECEMBER - 2023

contrast to a deﬁcit of $3.3 billion in the
previous year.
FDI reached $ 656.1 million during Jul-Nov
FY2024, an increase of 8.1 percent largely
due to Chinese investments. YoY
remittances grew by 3.6 percent in
November on the back of structural reforms
related to exchange companies and
consequent convergence of exchange rate
in interbank and open market.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)
decided to maintain the policy rate at 22
percent during its meeting on 12th
December 2023. The MPC assessed that
the real interest rate remains positive on a
12-month forward-looking basis. Further the
committee is optimistic that the headline
inﬂation rate will decline in the upcoming
months of FY2024. This anticipated
decrease is likely attributed to the easing of
supply constraints, particularly in agricultural
products, and a moderation in international
commodity prices.

International
Performance
and Outlook
The global economic growth has improved
in 2023, largely due to increased consumer
spending in China and accelerated growth
in the U.S. This positive change has helped
mitigate the signiﬁcant slowdown that
Europe experienced in 2022, caused by an
energy crisis. However, concerns remain
about the full effects of recent monetary
tightening, China's ongoing real estate
downturn, and the eurozone's stagnation.
Fitch Ratings anticipate a substantial
decrease in world economic growth in 2024,
predicting it to fall to 2.1%. For 2023, Fitch
has revised its global growth forecast
upwards by 0.4 percentage points to 2.9%,
from its previous prediction in the
September Global Economic Outlook.
US growth resilience reﬂects renewed ﬁscal
easing, consumers' willingness to continue
drawing on excess savings and robust
private-sector ﬁnances. The impact of

monetary tightening through the 'cash ﬂow'
channel of rising debt-service costs has
been limited so far. The U.S. economy grew
faster than expected in the third quarterGDP increased at a 5.2% annualized rate. It
was the fastest pace of expansion since the
fourth quarter of 2021. The CPI increased
by 3.1% in November- lower than 3.2% in
October. Inﬂation remains above the Fed's
2% target. The Federal Reserve (Fed)
decided to keep the overnight federal funds
rate steady in its range of 5.25% to 5.5% in
its latest policy meeting held in December2023. This marks the third consecutive
meeting where the central bank has chosen
to hold off on monetary policy changes. The
Fed's statements indicate three quarterpoint cuts next year. In its statement, the
Fed indicated that after its long tightening
campaign to battle decades-high inﬂation,
“inﬂation has eased over the past year but
remains elevated. The job gains accelerated
in November and the unemployment rate
fell to 3.7% from nearly a two-year high of
3.9% in October. According to Federal
Reserve Bank of New York's November
2023 “Survey of Consumer Expectations”,
median inﬂation expectations decreased
slightly to 3.4%, the lowest reading since
April 2021. The US economic situation also
reﬂected through growth in WEI-touches the
2.5 percent mark, highest during last one
year (Fig-1).

Developing Asia's growth has been upbeat
this year despite persistent headwinds.
Healthy domestic demand, strong
DECEMBER - 2023

remittances, and recovering tourism are
underpinning economic activity, which
continued to expand even as inﬂation
moderated. These drivers offset the drag
from slower global growth and the lagged
effects of monetary policy tightening, and
they are expected to continue fostering
growth in the region next year. According to
Asian Development Outlook (ADO) December 2023, the growth forecast for the
world is revised up from ADO September
2023's projection, to 4.9% from 4.7%, on
robust domestic demand. The 2024 forecast
is maintained at 4.8%.
The J. P. Morgan Global Composite Output
Index increased to 50.4 in November 2023
as against 50.0 in October 2023, signalling
expansion for the ninth time in the past ten
months. The services sector again
outperformed its manufacturing counterpart
in November. There were also some
positive signals coming out of the
manufacturing industry. Although production
volumes decreased for the sixth successive
month, the rate of contraction was negligible
and the weakest during that sequence.
Output growth was registered in seven of
the 14 nations for which November
Composite PMI data were available.
Pakistan's main exports market included
US, UK and China observed expansion
while Euro Area destinations included
Germany and France were among the
countries to experience contractions. The
monthly economic situation also evident
from CLI of Pakistan's main exports
destinations (Fig-2).
The FAO food prices index averaged at
120.4 points in November 2023, unchanged
from its revised October level, as increases
in the price indices for vegetable oils, dairy
products and sugar area offsetting the
decline in cereals and meat. The index
stood at 14.4 points (10.7 percent) below its
corresponding level one year ago.
Global commodity prices plummeted in
November 2023. Energy prices eased by
8.2%, led by coal (12.9%) and oil (8.7%).
Non-energy prices increased by 1.7%. Food
prices increased by 0.9%. beverage gained
(7%) and raw materials changed little.

Fertilizer prices plunged 2.9%. Metal price
soared by 2.7% led by Iron Ore 10.4% and
zinc 5.3%. Precious metal rose by 3.7%.

Products, Wearing apparel, Leather,
Chemicals, Pharmaceuticals, Non-Metallic
Mineral Products, Rubber Products,
Fabricated Metals, Machinery and
Equipment, and others (Football).
In Jul-Nov FY2024, the performance of
auto-industry remains subdued due to
massive increases in inputs prices, and
tightened auto ﬁnance. Car production and
sale decreased by 58.1 percent and 53.3
percent, while Trucks & Buses production

& Footwear (20.9%) and Perishable food
items (9.6%).
The SPI for the week ended on 21st
December, 2023, recorded a decline of 0.51
percent as compared to previous week.
Prices of 9 items declined, 24 items
remained stable and 18 items increased.
2.3 Fiscal
A substantial increase in revenues
compared to expenditures brought down the
ﬁscal deﬁcit to 0.8 percent of GDP
(Rs.861.7 billion) in Jul-Oct FY2024 from
1.5 percent of GDP (Rs.1265.8 billion) last
year. The primary surplus continued to
improve owing to contained growth in nonmarkup spending and recorded Rs.1429.7
billion (1.4 percent of GDP) during Jul-oct
FY2024 from Rs.136.2 billion (0.2 percent of
GDP) last year.
Net federal revenue receipts increased to
Rs.2806.6 billion in Jul-Oct FY2024 from
Rs.1316.8 billion last year. The sharp rise in
revenues has been largely attributed to
considerable improvement in non-tax
revenues that grew by more than 300
percent during the period under review. In
absolute terms, it increased to Rs. 1586.5
billion against Rs. 346.4 billion last year.
This growth in non-tax collection has been
observed across all major heads, indicating
a broad-based increase. Similarly, receipts
from FBR tax collections grew by 29 percent
to Rs.2748.4 billion against Rs.2138.7
billion last year.
The net provisional FBR tax collection
maintained its momentum with 29.6 percent
growth to reach Rs.3484.7 billion during JulNov FY2024 from Rs.2688.4 billion last
year. Within total, domestic tax revenues
grew by 32 percent driven primarily by a
62.8 percent surge in FED and a 42.2
percent rise in direct taxes.
Total expenditures grew by 35 percent to
stand at Rs.3706.7 billion during Jul-Oct
FY2024 against Rs.2737.2 billion last year.
Within total, current spending grew by 44
percent mainly due to a signiﬁcant rise in

markup payments that increased by 63
percent during the ﬁrst four months of the
current ﬁscal year, while non-markup
spending witnessed a restricted growth of
19 percent on account of the government's
cautious expenditure management strategy.
2.4 Monetary Sector
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has
maintained the policy rate at 22 percent in
its decision held on 12th December, 2023.
MPC noted that Nov-23 inﬂation was higher
than expected mainly due to gas price hike.
While it may have implications for near-term
inﬂation outlook, there are some offsetting
developments that include recent decrease
in international oil prices and better
agricultur output. MPC assessed that real
interest rate is positive on 12-month
DECEMBER - 2023

forward-looking basis and headline inﬂation
is expected to decline signiﬁcantly in the
second half of FY2024.
During 1st July – 01st December, FY2024
money supply (M2) shows growth of 1.3%
(Rs. 416.8 billion) compared 0.96% growth

reached $ 12.5 billion ($ 11.9 billion last
year). Imports (fob) declined by 16.0
percent reaching $ 21.3 billion ($ 25.3 billion
last year). Resultantly, the trade deﬁcit

Economic
Outlook

3.1 Inﬂation
Inﬂation outlook for the remaining months
of FY2024 is seen at a moderate level
despite the upward revision of administered
prices (gas prices). This is on account of a
stable exchange rate, contained aggregate
demand, better supply position, moderation
in the international commodity prices, and
favorable base effect. Moreover, the recent
decline in petrol and diesel prices is
expected to compensate the inﬂationary
pressure exerted through higher gas prices
as the decline in fuel prices has a
signiﬁcant impact on the common man
through reduced transportation and
production costs. Efforts of the sub-national
governments to implement lower fares of
public transport and freight charges in line
with the reduced fuel prices would further
ease the inﬂationary pressure.
The Food and Agriculture Organization's
food price index, which tracks the most
globally traded food commodities, averaged
120.4 points in November 2023 unchanged
from its revised October level, as increases
in the price indices for vegetable oils, dairy
products, and sugar counterbalanced
decreases in those of cereals and meat.
The index stood 14.4 points (10.7 percent)
below its corresponding level one year ago.
Keeping in view the better supply position
and easing out the imported inﬂation along
DECEMBER - 2023

7

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

with the high base effect will help to contain
the inﬂationary pressure ahead. Inﬂation is
anticipated to remain around 27.5-28.5
percent in December 2023 and further ease
out to 24-25 percent in January 2024.
3.2 Agriculture
The prospects of achieving production
targets are positive. The certiﬁed seeds
were used by the farmers while DAP
fertilizer offtake has increased more than
urea. December is important for the early
growth of Rabi crops 2023-24 in most of the
agricultural plains of the country. Farmers
may take precautionary measures to protect
their crops, vegetables, and orchids from
the harmful impacts of expected cold
weather conditions. Furthermore, farmers of
northern areas and northern Balochistan
may complete the sowing of their Rabi
crops in time and arrange suitable irrigation
for healthier growth of their crops at initial
levels.

The cyclical LSM pattern for the month of
October remained below the potential level.
However, improvement in MoM imports, and
positive trends in high-frequency indicators
like sales and production on tractors, and
total cement dispatches indicate a potential
recovery in industrial activities. It is
expected that industrial activities may
recover and improve in the coming months.
3.4 Overall Economic Activity
The Monthly Economic Indicator (MEI) is
developed as a tool to distribute the past
annual GDP numbers, reported by the PBS,
on a monthly/quarterly basis, and to
nowcast GDP growth for the FY in which the
National Accounts are not yet available on
the same frequency. The ﬁgure presents the
MEI since July 2019. It should be noted that
some of the data underlying the November
2023 MEI are still provisional and may be
revised next month.

3.3 Industrial activity
The LSM cycle usually follows the cyclical
movements in the main trading partners, but
since it is focused on the main industrial
sectors and not on total GDP, it is somewhat
more volatile than the cyclical component of
GDP in Pakistan's main export markets. The
aggregate CLI in the main export markets
has improved and reached its potential
level. This suggests positive momentum in
the external environment, which is crucial
for Pakistan's industrial performance.

Improvement in CLI of Pakistan's export
markets signiﬁes a favourable export
landscape while continuous increase in
MoM imports signals increased economic
activities and demand for goods and
services. Further, reducing inﬂationary
pressures supported by a decline in
international commodity prices, easing of
supply constraints, and the government's
various policy and administrative measures
demonstrate better growth prospects.
According to the ﬁrst quarter GDP
estimates, the economy grew by 2.13

DECEMBER - 2023

8

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

percent against 0.96 percent in ﬁrst quarter
of FY2023. The growth is primarily driven by
5.06 percent in agriculture, 2.48 percent in
Industry, and 0.82 percent in the services
sector. Based on improvement in key
economic indicators, it is expected that this
positive momentum observed in the ﬁrst
quarter will gain further traction in the
upcoming months.
3.5 External
BoP data for November shows some
developments, as exports of goods and
services increased by 12.2 percent on a
YoY basis and marginally by 0.2 percent on
a MoM basis, respectively. Exports are
consistently above $3.0 billion mark since
Aug-23. On the other hand, November
imports of goods and services were at $ 5.3
billion, marginally higher than their level of $
5.2 billion observed in October and $ 5.0
billion in Nov-22. Resultantly, the trade
balance of goods and services decreased
by 4.3 percent on YoY basis but increased
by 3.3 percent on MoM basis. In the coming
months, it is expected that exports would
remain at around current observed level and
take advantage of increase in domestic
economic activities and encouraging foreign
demand. Similarly, imports will continue to
observe their increasing momentum in
coming months with assumptions of stable
exchange rate and soothed global
commodity prices.
Current account balance turns to surplus in
November, mainly due to decline in primary
income debit, which decreased signiﬁcantly
by 36 percent on MoM basis. For the
outlook, considering all other components of
secondary income included worker's
remittances as well as primary income
balance, the current account will remain in a
manageable limit.
3.6 Fiscal
The ﬁscal performance during the ﬁrst four
months highlights the effective
implementation of consolidation measures
that resulted in a substantial increase in

overall revenue receipts that outpaced the
growth in expenditures. As a result, the
ﬁscal deﬁcit in terms of GDP has been
successfully brought down to 0.8 percent of
GDP and improved the primary surplus to
Rs.1429.7 billion in the ﬁrst four months of
FY2024.
On the revenue side, FBR tax revenues
have surpassed the target by Rs.27 billion
set for Jul-Nov FY2024. The revenue
performance indicates that tax policy and
administrative measures are paying off in
terms of continuous improvement in
revenue collection. With this pace, it is
expected that the tax collection target for
FY2024 will be achieved.
Similarly, cautious expenditure management
played an instrumental role in controlling
non-essential spending, however, the
challenge of higher markup payments
persists. Considering this, the government
will continue the current ﬁscal strategy to
achieve set targets, emphasizing both
revenue enhancement and prudent
expenditure control.
3.7 Final Remarks
Despite signiﬁcant challenges, the overall
economic outlook is optimistic marked by
receding inﬂationary pressures, positive
prospects in agriculture, signs of potential
recovery in the industrial sector reﬂected by
positive trends in high-frequency indicators,
imports, and a favorable external
environment.
The optimistic economic outlook is also
evident by the 2.13 percent growth achieved
in the ﬁrst quarter of FY2024, largely
contributed by agriculture and industry.
Further, the twin deﬁcit is on a downward
trajectory signifying better economic
management to reduce the macroeconomic
imbalances. This lays the foundation for
progressing towards higher and sustainable
economic growth. It is therefore expected
that this positive momentum will further
strengthen in the upcoming months.
