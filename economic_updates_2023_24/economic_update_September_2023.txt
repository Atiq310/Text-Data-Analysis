Executive
Summary

T

he global economy is showing signs
of an upturn, poised to grow faster
than it was projected in the first half
of 2023. Nonetheless, these improvements
remain fragile with a slower economic
rebound in China, persistent core inflation,
elevated interest rates, and lingering
geopolitical uncertainties continuing to exert
pressure on economic activities.
Since the beginning of FY2024, Pakistan's
economy stepped up on the recovery path.
In August FY2024, month-on-month exports
increased by 14.2 percent while imports
grew by 2.1 percent for the same period.
The upturn in the global economy coupled
with relaxed import restrictions, is mitigating
disruptions in the supply of raw materials
and supporting export-oriented industries.
FDI also increased by 16.1 percent during
Jul-Aug FY2024 on account of rise in
Chinese investments and exchange rate
stability.
In the agriculture sector, the arrival of cotton
in September 2023 posted a remarkable
growth of 79.9 percent to 3.93 million bales
compared to 2.19 million bales during same
period last year. This surge reflects a
growing focus on enhancing cotton
production which is encouraging for the
export and overall economic outlook in
FY2024.

The large manufacturing scale sector (LSM)
is recovering from slump. Although LSM
remained negative in July FY2024,
however, 09 out of 22 sectors picked up
positive growth including Food (10.0%),
Tobacco (54.0%), Wearing Apparel (30.8%),
Pharmaceuticals (54.0%), Chemicals
(5.9%), and others. The better input
situation through lifting of import restriction
paving the way of sectoral growth. However,
several sectors are still under pressure as
tight financing facilities and inflationary
pressures persistently hinder their
production activities.
CPI inflation recorded at 27.4 percent on a
year-on-year basis in August 2023 as
compared to 27.3 percent in August 2022.
On a month-on-month basis, it increased to
1.7 percent in August 2023 compared to an
increase of 3.5 percent in the previous
month. The government's stern
administrative measures to curtail the
hoarding of commodities and foreign
currency measures resulted in moderating
the inflation pressure. However, given the
international oil price pressure and
adjustment in energy prices, uncertainty in
inflation will remain.
On the fiscal side, the fiscal deficit in July,
FY2024 remained 0.2 percent of GDP
almost the same level as last year whereas
the primary balance surplus improved to Rs
311.2 billion from Rs 142.2 billion last year.
The improvement in fiscal accounts is
attributed to a significant upsurge in net
federal revenues, which outpaced the
growth in total expenditures. Net federal
revenues grew by 66 percent largely
primarily driven by a notable increase in
non-tax collections, particularly stemming
from higher receipts related to the
petroleum development levy. On the other
hand, new tax measures and increased
collection from import-related taxes
contributed to raise tax collection. Within
expenditures, although markup payments
grew by 52 percent, non-markup spending
was reduced by 48 percent. This reduction
in non-markup spending played a key role
in improving the primary surplus during July
FY2024.

The Current Account posted a deficit of $
935 million for Jul-Aug FY2024 as against a
deficit of $ 2.0 billion last year, largely
reflecting an improvement in the trade
balance. During the same period, workers'
remittances recorded at $ 4.1 billion ($ 5.3
billion last year), decreased by 21.6
percent, mainly on account of slowdown in
the host countries, and the wedge between
the exchange rate in interbank and open
market.
MPC has maintained the policy rate at 22
percent in September 2023, on account of
an improved inflation outlook. During 1st July
– 1st September, FY2024 money supply
shows negative growth of 1.8 percent
compared to negative growth of 1.3 percent
during the same period last year. This is
due to decline in the NDA of the banking
sector.
The government is laying the foundation for
short to long-term measures that will
improve the near-term economic situation
during FY2024.

International
Performance
and Outlook
The global economic outlook remains weak.
Uncertainty around the trajectory of the
world economy remains high despite
waning fear of a global recession and
expectation of moderate pick-up in growth
of many regions. Global headwinds persist,
and the prospects of a stronger recovery
next year have dimmed, due to mounting
concerns about the vitality of China's
economy following its post-COVID
reopening at the end of 2022. The IMF
notes that global growth is currently heavily
reliant on expansions in the majority of
emerging and developing economies,
whereas there is a continuing slowdown
across 93 percent in advanced economies.
Asia and the Pacific continuing their solid
economic recovery. Growth is holding up,
supported by strong domestic demand,
rebounding tourism, and stable financial

conditions, even as export demand remains
weak. Inflation is slowing, on account of
lower food and energy prices as well as
timely action by central banks across the
region. Asian Development Outlook
September 2023 forecasts that economies
in developing Asia and the Pacific will
expand by 4.7%. However, it was observed
that recovery is still fragile. The growth is
accompanied by climate risks, supply-chain
disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine conflict,
as well as restrictions on food exports, this
could exacerbate food inflation and food
insecurity. Continued weakness in China's
property sector could slow growth in Asia's
largest economy.
According to the Fed Beige Book, US
economic growth was modest amid a
softening labor market with moderate wage
growth and slowing inflation pressures in
July, strengthening expectations that the
Fed's fastest hiking cycle in decades is
coming to an end. The Fed is widely
expected to leave its benchmark overnight
interest rate in the current 5.25-5.50 percent
range at the end of its September policy
meeting while leaving open the door to a
final quarter-percentage-point hike before
end of the year 2023. In August 2023, CPI
increased by 0.6 percent on a MoM basis,
bringing inflation to over 3.7 percent on YoY
basis compared to 3.2 percent reported for
July 2023. The 10.6 percent increase in
gasoline prices contributed to inflation
number.
US inflation expectations fell in early
September to the lowest levels in more than
two years as consumers grew more
optimistic about the economic outlook.
According to JP Morgan, economic outlook
for the US economy is better than expected
and a recession could be avoided. The US
economy has expanded at an estimated
rate of 2.0 percent in Q1 and 2.4 percent in
Q2 reflecting the momentum of projected
growth in the first half of the year 2023.
Consumer spending which drives 65
percent of GDP - has been resilient
throughout 2023. However, if consumer
spending moderates as expected in the
second half, growth could slow down during

SEPTEMBER - 2023

the second half of 2023. The US economic
situation is also reflected through the
cyclical trend in WEI which indicates an
increasing trend in recent months (Fig-1).

demand (Fig-2).

The global economic expansion further
decelerated into the third quarter. The J.P.
Morgan Global PMI Composite Output
Index - produced by S&P Global – recorded
at 50.6 in August, down from 51.6 in July,
2023. This is the third straight month in
which the rate of expansion declined to now
sit at the slowest since the global economy
returned to growth in February. The current
reading is broadly consistent with an
annualized quarterly global GDP growth of
just under 1 percent, which is below the
long-run average of 2.9 percent.
The expansion of output remained exclusive
to the service sector as manufacturing
output contracted marginally for a third
straight month. Deterioration in global trade
remained the key driver for the latest
developments, although some signs of
global destocking signal some relief in the
coming months.
Meanwhile, the service sector remained in
expansion, but the rate of growth continued
to trend lower to the weakest since January.
Weakening service sector growth
momentum is partly attributed to softer
consumer services conditions as the recent
travel surge fades. The global situation is
also evident from the monthly CLI position
of Pakistan's main trading partners, of

The FAO food prices index (FFPI) averaged
121.4 points in August 2023, down by 2.1
points from July. The decline in August was
driven by a significant decrease in the price
indices for vegetable oils by 3.1 percent,
sunflower oil by 8.0 percent, cereal price by
0.7 percent, wheat by 3.8 percent, and
coarse grain price by 3.4 percent.
Global commodity prices soared in August
2023. Energy prices increased by 7.8
percent, led by 17.3 percent increase in
natural gas in Europe and 8.5 percent in
coal in Australia. Non-energy prices

declined by 1.2 percent. Food prices
decreased by 2.2 percent. Beverage gained
by 1.4 percent while raw materials eased by
0.7 percent. Fertilizer prices soared 8.2
percent. Metal price declined by 1.9 percent
led by 9.3 percent decline in tin. Precious
metal dropped by 1.9 percent led by a 3.4
percent drop in sliver.

2.1 Real Sector
2.1-a Agriculture
According to the Pakistan Cotton Ginners'
Association (PCGA), arrivals of Cotton as of
15th September 2023 posted a remarkable
growth of 79.9 percent to 3.93 million bales
compared to 2.19 million bales during the
same period last year. This surge reflects a
growing focus on enhancing cotton
production. If the cotton crop production
continues to thrive, it will augur well for the
economic outlook.
For Jul-Aug FY2024, farm tractor production
inched up by 6.5 percent to 6,189 and its
sales also increased by 27.3 percent to
6,645 compared to the corresponding
period last year. During July FY2024, the
agriculture credit disbursement was
recorded at Rs 151 billion as compared to
Rs 112 billion last year showing an increase
of 35.1 percent. During Jul-Aug 2023, urea
and DAP offtake for Kharif 2023 was 2,757
thousand tonnes (4.9 percent more than
Kharif 2022) and 650 thousand tonnes (51.9
percent higher than Kharif 2022),
respectively.

2.1-b Manufacturing
The headwinds of FY2023 continued to
prevail in the ongoing fiscal year as LargeScale Manufacturing (LSM) could not
outperform in July 2023 and remained in
negative territory. On YoY basis, LSM
declined by 1.09 percent in July 2023, while
on MoM basis, it decreased by 3.62

percent. During the period, 9 sectors
witnessed positive growth including, Food,
Tobacco, Wearing apparel, Chemicals,
Pharmaceuticals, Rubber Products, NonMetallic Mineral Products, Machinery and
Equipment, and others (Football).
The auto industry remained under pressure
due to ongoing inflationary pressures and
tight auto financing. The downturn was
evident across all categories except
tractors. Car production and sales
decreased by 59.5 percent and 50.4
percent, Jul-Aug FY2024 while Trucks &
Buses production and sale decreased by
63.2 percent and 41.1 percent.
The sale of petroleum products declined by
7 percent during Jul-Aug FY2024 to 2.8 mn
tons against 3.0 mn tons in the same period
last year. While in August 2023, a decline of
8 percent is observed in oil sales reaching
1.40 mn tons from 1.52 mn tons.
On a positive note, total cement dispatches
significantly grew by 45 percent during JulAug FY2024 and reached to 7.7 mn tons
against the period of last year. In August
2023, cement dispatches surged by 37
percent and stood at 4.518 mn tons against
3.297 mn tons same period last year. Local
cement sales by the industry came in at
3.793 mn tons in August 2023, a substantial
growth of 30.4 percent from the last year.
Whereas exports witnessed a healthy
increase of 87.1 percent from 387,440 tons
to 724,777 tons during the same period.

2.2 Inflation

Fig-4: Fiscal Indicators % of GDP (Jul)

CPI inflation increased to 27.4 percent on
YoY basis in August 2023 as compared to
27.3 percent in August 2022. On a Monthon-month (MoM) basis, it increased to 1.7
percent in August 2023 compared to an
increase of 3.5 percent in the previous
month.
Major drivers contributing to the year-onyear increase in CPI include nonperishable
food items (42.8 percent), Perishable food
items (12.7 percent), Alcoholic Beverages &
Tobacco (97.5 percent), Clothing &
Footwear (18.5 percent), Housing, Water,
Electricity, gas & Fuel (6.3 percent), Health
(22.6 percent), Transport (23.0 percent) and
Recreation and Culture (61.4 percent).
The SPI for the week ended on 21st
September 2023, recorded an increase of
0.93 percent as compared to the previous
week. Prices of 11 items declined, 18 items
remained stable and 22 items increased.

Fig-5: FBR Tax Collection (Rs. bn) (Jul FY24)

2.3 Fiscal
The net federal revenues grew significantly
by 66.4 percent in July FY2024 to Rs 380.9
billion against Rs 228.9 billion last year. The
primary factor in the revenue performance
was a substantial rise in non-tax collection,
which soared to Rs 139.4 billion in July
FY2024 from Rs 40.8 billion last year.
Amongst all, higher receipts from petroleum
levy, royalties on oil/gas, and the United
Nations played a vital role in improving the
non-tax collection. On the other hand, FBR
tax collection grew by 23.0 percent to Rs
538.4 billion in July FY2024 against Rs
437.4 billion last year.
FBR net provisional tax collection during
July-Aug FY2024 grew by 27.2 percent to
Rs 1207.5 against Rs 949.1 billion last year.
In the month of August 2023, FBR collected
36.4 percent more taxes to reach Rs,669.1
billion from Rs 490.7 billion last year. FBR
tax collection has surpassed both its
monthly and Jul-Aug FY2024 targets by Rs
20.0 billion and Rs 24.4 billion, respectively.
During Jul-Aug FY2024, direct tax revenues
increased by 42.2 percent, sales tax by 16.6
percent, FED by 58.0 percent, and customs
duty by 11.3 percent. Overall, the growth of

Source: FBR

domestic tax was recorded at 30.2 percent,
indicating the revival of economic activities
and sales.
As compared to revenues, total
expenditures grew by 20 percent to Rs
644.9 billion in July FY2024 against Rs
536.2 billion last year. Within total, current
spending increased by 18.0 percent on
account of a 52.0 percent rise in markup
payments, while non-markup current
spending reduced by 48.3 percent.
Consequently, in July FY2024, the primary
balance showed a surplus of Rs 311.2
billion (0.3 percent of GDP) against the
surplus of Rs 142.2 billion (0.2 percent of
GDP) last year. Overall fiscal deficit
remained at 0.2 percent of GDP in July
FY2024 almost the same as last year.

2.4 Monetary
Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has
maintained the policy rate at 22 percent, a
decision held on 14th September 2023. This
decision considers the latest inflation
outturn reflecting the continuing declining
trend in inflation from its peak of 38 percent
in May to 27.4 percent in August 2023.
Even though global oil prices have risen
recently and are being passed on to
consumers through adjustments in energy
prices, inflation is projected to remain on a
downward trajectory, especially from the
second half of FY2024. During 1st July –1st
September, FY2024 money supply showed
negative growth of 1.8 percent (Rs -563.0
billion) compared to negative growth of 1.3
percent (Rs -350.4 billion) last year. Within
M2, NFA increased by Rs174.0 billion as
compared to a decrease of Rs 432.6 billion
last year. Whereas the NDA of the banking
sector decreased by Rs 737.1 billion as
compared to an increase of Rs 82.2 billion
last year.

2.5 External Sector
The Current Account posted a deficit of $
935 million for Jul-Aug FY2024 as against a
deficit of $ 2.0 billion last year, largely
reflecting an improvement in the trade
balance. Exports (fob) declined by 8.3
percent and reached $ 4.5 billion ($ 4.9
billion last year). Imports (fob) declined by
26.0 percent and reached $ 8.5 billion ($
11.5 billion last year). Resultantly the trade
deficit reached $ 3.9 billion as against $ 6.5
billion last year.
During the period under review, exports in
Services increased by 2.1 percent to $ 1135
million as against $ 1112 million same
period last year. The imports in services
increased by 24.7 percent to $ 1598 million
as compared to $ 1281 million same period
last year. The trade deficit in services stood
at $ 463 million as against $169 million last
year.
As per PBS, the export commodities that
registered positive growth include Fish &
Fish Preparation (29.0 percent in quantity &
and 3.3 percent in value), Fruits (40.3
percent in quantity & 0.9 percent in value),

Cotton Yarn (44.6 percent in quantity & 25.8
percent in value), Towel (17.8 percent in
quantity & 6.5 percent in value) and Plastic
Materials (152.4 percent in quantity & 31.9
percent in value). Whereas, main imported
commodities were Petroleum products ($
971.4 million), Petroleum crude ($ 456.2
million), Liquefied Natural gas ($ 645.4
million), Palm Oil ($ 552.4million), Plastic
materials ($ 431.6 million), Iron & Steel ($
309.6 million) and Medicinal products ($
177.1 million).

2.5.1 Foreign Investment
Total foreign investment during Jul-Aug
FY2024 recorded an inflow of $ 260.4
million as against $ 176.4 million last year.
FDI reached $ 233.8 million during Jul-Aug
FY2024 ($ 201.4 million last year)
increasing by 16.1 percent. FDI received
from China $ 50.4 million (21.6 percent),
Netherlands $ 42.6 million (18.2 percent)
Switzerland $ 36.5 million (15.6 percent of
total FDI), and Hong Kong $ 33.0 million
(14.1 percent). Power sector attracted the
highest FDI of $ 97.6 million (41.8 percent
of total FDI), Oil & Gas exploration $ 29.2
million (12.5 percent), and Pharmaceuticals
& OTC products $ 25.4 million (10.9
percent).
Foreign Private Portfolio Investment has
registered a net inflow of $ 22.7 million
during the same period. Foreign Public
Portfolio Investment recorded a net inflow of
$ 3.9 million. The total foreign portfolio
investment recorded an inflow of $ 26.6
million as against an outflow of $ 25.0
million last year.

2.5.2 Worker's Remittances
In Jul-Aug FY2024, workers' remittances
decreased by 21.6 percent to $ 4.1 billion ($
5.3 billion last year). MoM, remittances
increased by 3.1 percent in August 2023 ($
2.1 billion) as compared to July 2023 ($ 2.0
billion). Major sources of remittances are
Saudi Arabia 23.7 percent ($ 976.9 million),
U.A.E 15.1 percent ($ 623.5 million), U.K
15.5 percent ($ 637.9 million), USA 12.2
percent ($ 503.7 million), other GCC
countries 11.5 percent ($ 472.8 million), EU
13.9 percent ($ 573.8 million), Canada 1.7

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

percent ($ 71.5 million), and other countries
6.5 percent ($ 261.9 million). The decline is
attributed to the global economic slowdown
as higher inflation in developed countries
has led to higher cost of living abroad, thus
reducing the surplus funds that could be
sent back to homeland as remittances, and
the wedge between the exchange rate in
interbank and open market.

2.5.3 Foreign Exchange Reserves
Pakistan's total liquid foreign exchange
reserves increased to $ 13.2 billion on
September 26, 2023, as the SBP's reserves
stood at $ 7.7 billion and Commercial banks'
reserves remained at $ 5.5 billion.

2.6 Performance of KSE Index
The performance of Pakistan Stock
Exchange (PSX) remained volatile during
the month of August 2023, ranges between
45,081 – 48,765 points. However, the index
remained significantly higher than its 6month average i.e., 43,245. The market
capitalization of PSX settled at Rs 6,716
billion as of 31st August 2023. During JulAug 2023, the KSE-100 index increased by
2.7 percent, while the S&P 500 of the US
increased by 1.2 percent. Contrary, the SSE
Composite of China declined by 3.8
percent, the CAC 40 of France declined by
0.9 percent and the Sensex 30 of India
declined by 0.6 percent. The performance
of major world indices indexed at 100 is

Note: All indices are standardized to 100 on the
initial day of the sample taken in this ﬁgure.

International food prices have been
experiencing a decline during August 2023.
The Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO)'s price index, which tracks the most
globally traded food commodities, averaged
121.4 points in August 2023 against 124.0
for the previous month. The August figure
was the lowest since March 2021 and also
24 percent below than an all-time high in
March 2022, in the wake of Russia's

SEPTEMBER - 2023

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

invasion of Ukraine. The decline in most of
the food commodities is offsetting the
increases in rice and sugar.
Domestically, the government's stern
administrative action against the unlawful
foreign exchange dealers and hoarders in
commodity markets is stabilizing the
exchange rate, providing a respite to the
imported inflation and easing out commodity
prices. The SBP has also maintained the
policy rate to the previous level in view of
anchored inflationary expectations. The
impact of the double-digit base effect is a
relief to the September inflation; however,
its impact seems to be minimized owing to
the major increase in fuel price in the month
of September 2023. Together with this, the
upward adjustment in energy tariffs is
further likely to intensify inflationary
pressures in the coming months as these
price adjustments are expected to place
additional burden on transportation costs,
essential items, and services. In view of the
above, inflation is anticipated to remain high
in the coming month. In September 2023, it
is expected to be around 29 to 31 percent.

3.2 Agriculture
The agricultural outlook for Kharif 2023
seems promising as the input demand
shows an uptick due to lucrative incentives
by the government, however, there may be
downside risks due to climate shocks. The
recent pest attack on cotton crops may
pose substantial risks to the cotton yield.

3.4 Overall Economic Activity
The Monthly Economic Indicator (MEI) is
developed as a tool to distribute the past
annual GDP numbers, reported by the PBS,
on a monthly/quarterly basis, and to
nowcast GDP growth for the FY in which the
National Accounts are not yet available on
the same frequency. Figure presents the
MEI on a monthly basis since January
2019. It should be noted that some of the
data underlying the August, 2023 MEI are
still provisional and may be revised next
month.

19.4

3.3 Industrial activity
The LSM cycle usually follows the cyclical
movements in the main trading partners, but
since it is focused on the main industrial
sectors and not on total GDP, it is
somewhat more volatile than the cyclical
component of GDP in Pakistan's main
export markets. The aggregate CLI in the
main export markets continued to remain
below the potential level since April 2022.
The cyclical LSM pattern in the month of
July showed some improvement though still
below the potential level. For the month of
August, the pressure is expected to ease
out further on the back of significant
rebounds in cement dispatches and the
removal of import restrictions.

rising cement dispatches. As the
government is striving hard to revive the
economy, MEI is expected to be positive
throughout the outgoing fiscal year.

3.5 External
August-FY2024 BoP data shows some
developments - as exports of goods and
services increased by 13.8 percent on MoM
basis, and imports of goods and services
increased marginally by 1.4 percent. As a
result, strong growth in exports has been
transmitted in the trade deficit of goods and
services which decreased by 12.6 percent
on MoM basis in the month of August.
Similarly, worker's remittances increased by
3.2 percent in August 2023. All these
positive factors impacted the current
account and its deficit decreased by around
79 percent on both MoM and YoY basis.
For the outlook, recent administrative
measures against speculative activity in the
foreign exchange market in the month of
September will impact positively
remittances inflows, trade, and current
account balance. Moreover, Pakistan's main
export markets particularly US, UK, Euro
Area and China's monthly CLI positions
indicate an upward trend, indicating positive
prospects for export growth in the coming
months. However, imports will gradually
increase to stimulate economic activities in
the economy. Therefore, it is expected that
the current account will remain with a
sustainable limit.

3.6 Fiscal
In July FY2024, fiscal performance
remained satisfactory while exhibiting a
surplus in the primary balance accompanied
by a fiscal deficit at the same level as last
year. On the revenue side, new tax
measures are contributing to direct tax
collection. Other components of tax
collection like FED have also posted
significant growth mainly due to an uptick in
collections at the import stage. With the

removal of import restrictions, the collection
from import-related taxes is likely to
increase further. Similarly, the increase in
sales tax is primarily attributed to 25.6
percent from domestic collection. Overall
performance signifies the revival of
economic activities and sales. These
developments collectively bode well for
achieving the tax collection target in the first
quarter of FY2024.
The government is actively engaged in
implementing a strategy to ensure fiscal
sustainability through revenue-enhancing
initiatives and prudent expenditure
management. The government is
particularly focusing on restricting nonmarkup expenses through the
implementation of austerity measures and
targeted subsidies. The main objectives are
to limit the fiscal deficit to 6.5 percent of
GDP and to keep the primary balance in
surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP during
FY2024.

3.7 Final Remarks
Recent administrative measures aimed at
improving the availability of essential food
commodities and expected ease in supply
constraints have improved the inflation
outlook. Moreover, administrative and
regulative action for curbing illegal activities
in the foreign exchange market have started
to yield desired dividends and narrowing the
gap between interbank and open market
exchange rates. On the external front,
current account deficit and aligned
indicators are showing some developments
in August. Similarly, fiscal performance
remains satisfactory at the start of FY2024.
It is expected that the economic revival plan
and prudent actions - policies including
SIFC and IT policy- will attract new
investments to create a multiplier effect in
the economy for higher and inclusive
economic growth in FY2024 and further in
the medium term.
