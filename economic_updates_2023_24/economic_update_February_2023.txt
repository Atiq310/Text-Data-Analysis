Execu ve
Summary
§ The global economy is expected to

slow down to the level of 2.9 percent
in the year 2023, mainly due to
stabilization measures, and
geopolitical frictions. Accordingly,
global trade growth is also expected
to decline to 2.4 percent despite an
easing of supply bottlenecks. Further,
the reopening of China's economy has
the potential to stimulate a rapid
global recovery.

§ In Pakistan, estimates of ongoing Rabi
season for wheat sowing in 2022-23
has achieved 96 percent, covering
21.94 million acres. Moreover, the
increased disbursement of
agriculture credit is expected to
further boost wheat production,
leading to a target of 28.4 million
tonnes, indicating a promising outlook
for farmers and the agricultural
sector. However, the favorable
weather conditions, the availability of
high-quality seeds, and su cient
fertilizers would be critical in
achieving targeted output.

§ CPI inﬂation reached 27.6 percent on
year-on-year basis in January 2023
whereas for Jul-Jan FY 2022-23, it is
recorded at 25.4 percent.

§ Total revenues grew by 18.8 percent

to reach PKR 4,699 billion during the
ﬁrst half of FY2022-23 against PKR
3,956 billion in the same period of last
year. The major contribution to this
growth came from 26.4 percent
increase in non-tax collection, while
tax collection has also shown
remarkable performance by posting a
growth of 17 percent.

§ Total expenditures for the ﬁrst half of
the current ﬁscal year increased by
19.8 percent to PKR 6,382 billion
given the increase in mark-up

payment which surged by 77 percent
due to rise in debt servicing.

§ During 1st July– 27th January, FY

2022-23, money supply (M2)
observed growth of 0.4 percent
compared to growth of 0.7 percent in
last year. Monetary Policy Committee,
on January 23, 2023, has increased
the policy rate by 100 basis points to
17 percent on account of persistent
inﬂationary pressures in the
economy.

§ The contraction in imports allowed

the Current Account deﬁcit to decline
signiﬁcantly to USD 3.8 billion for JulJan FY2022-23 as against a deﬁcit of
USD 11.6 billion during same period
last year.

Interna onal
Economic Performance and Outlook
Global growth is projected to decelerate
to 2.9 percent in 2023 before rising to
3.1 percent in 2024 (World Economic
Outlook –January 2023). While the
outlook for 2023 is 0.2 percentage points
higher than the previous forecasts, it still
falls below the historical average of 3.8
percent. This slower growth is being
attributed to rising interest rates and the
ongoing Russia-Ukraine conﬂict, which
are weighing on economic activity.
However, China's recent reopening
enabled a faster-than-expected recovery
and is expected to positively impact
global growth in the coming years. Global
inﬂation is anticipated to decline from
6.6 percent in 2023 to 4.3 percent in
2024, but it is still projected to remain
above pre-pandemic levels.
Economic activity in China slowed in the
fourth quarter of 2022 due to several
COVID-19 outbreaks in densely
populated localities, including Beijing.
The outbreaks prompted renewed
lockdowns that remained in place until

FEBRUARY 2023

COVID-19 restrictions which relaxed in
November and December, facilitating a
full reopening. Despite, real estate
investment in China continued to
contract, and the restructuring of
developers is taking place at a slow pace,
mainly due to the lingering property
market crisis. Furthermore, consumer
and business sentiment remained
subdued in late 2022. As a result, global
trade growth has also decreased,
leading to a drop in international
commodity prices.
The Global Trade Update from UNCTAD
projects that the slowdown in global
trade which began in the second half of
the year, will continue to worsen in 2023.
This is mainly due to the persistence of
geopolitical tensions and tight ﬁnancial
conditions. Several factors, such as
geopolitical shocks, globalization,
climate action, and technology, are also
expected to have a signiﬁcant impact on

trade and investment in the coming year,
2024.
The FAO Food Prices Index (FFPI)
averaged 131.2 points in January 2023,
down 1.1 points from December, marking
the tenth consecutive monthly declines.
The decrease in the index in January was
mainly due to sharp decline in
international prices of vegetable oils,
dairy and sugar, while those of cereals
and meat remained mostly stable.
The Federal Reserve has increased
interest rates by a quarter percentage
point, with the federal funds rate for
open market operations now in a target
range of 4.5-4.75 percent. The rate hike
was followed by unexpectedly strong job
data for January, which suggested that
the central bank may need to raise rates
further to better balance strong demand.
The Fed's Monetary Policy Committee
believes that if there is continued

Reopening of China: An Opportunity for Pakistan and the World
China has ﬁnally lifted pandemic restrictions and resumed mobility. This will result in a
pickup of economic activity and provide momentum to the international economy. Last
year, China faced its most signiﬁcant economic setback as the COVID-19 outbreak led to
several lockdowns and a decline in economic growth. However, the recent reversal of
policy and reopening ignited the optimistic expectations that the economy will return to
its footings this spring. It is projected that the Chinese economy will grow by 5.2 percent
this year, compared to 3 percent in the previous year.
Evidence suggests that if Chinese economy grows by 1 percentage point, the economic
growth in other countries rise by around 0.3 percentage points. The factories in China
produce a signiﬁcant portion of the world's manufacturing output, surpassing the US,
Germany, and Japan combined. This highlights that implementation of appropriate
policies in China would not only boost the Chinese economy but would also be beneﬁcial
for other countries of the world.
International ﬁnancial institutions predict that China will account for one-third of
international growth during the current year. The largest beneﬁciaries from China's
rebounding will possibly be the oil exporters and its Asian neighboring countries,
according to Goldman Sachs. As China's yearly food imports reached approximately
USD 266 billion and are expected to increase over the years, Pakistan can beneﬁt from
the signiﬁcant and enhanced consumption patterns of the food sector within the
Chinese economy. Pakistan is a home to the Chinese ﬂagship initiative, i.e., CPEC. This
initiative slowed down during previous government, and it is high time to revive the
program to put Pakistan on the trajectory of sustainable development by connecting
Pakistan to 150 markets worldwide through the BRI.

strength in labour market or higher
inﬂation, it may be necessary to increase
rates further over time.
The January 2023 "Survey of Consumer
Expectations" from the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York indicates little change
in inﬂation expectations for the short,
medium, and long term. Similarly,
expectations for labour and household
ﬁnances have remained mostly stable,
with the exception of a signiﬁcant drop in
household income growth expectations
in January but remain above their prepandemic levels.
US Services Business Activity in January
2023 registered a value of 54.7 percent,
indicating a positive development in the
service sector business activities. The
index value above 50 percent signiﬁes an
expansion in the service sector. To bring
inﬂation back down to the central bank's
target rate, the Federal Reserve is
increasing interest rates. This has
resulted in the US central bank's ratehiking cycle being the fastest since the
1980s.
However, the US manufacturing sector
experienced a contraction for the third
straight month in January 2023, with an
index value of 47.4 percent, which was
lower than December 2022's 48.4
percent. This contraction was led by a
decline in the new orders and production
index, indicating a further lowering
demand. It is anticipated that
manufacturing activity will experience
more di culty over the next few months
due to tight monetary policy and
previous tightening in ﬁnancial
conditions (Figure 1).

most growth, as both China and Japan
returned to expansion after recent
declines, and India continued to
experience robust growth. However, the
manufacturing PMI dropped to 47.4 in
January 2023 from 48.4 in December
2022, contracting for a second straight
month after a period of expansion lasting
30 months.
In January 2023, CLIs showed slow
growth in the OECD and other major
economies, primarily due to factors such
as high inﬂation, rising interest rates,
and declining share prices.
The CLIs also indicate that growth is
likely to lose momentum in the US, the
UK, and Canada, as well as in the Euro

The J. P. Morgan Global Composite
Output Index showed the signs of
improvement in January 2023 with an
increase to 49.8 from 48.2 in December
2022. The manufacturing sector, which
had been experiencing a decline, showed
some improvement, while the service
sector marked higher growth following a
period of contraction lasting three
months. Asia was the region with the

area, including Germany, France, and
Italy. However, there is some
stabilization in the CLI for China's
industrial sector, driven by the
production of motor vehicles and rising
share prices.
Global commodity prices showed a mixed
performance in January 2023. Energy
prices experienced a decline of 8.9
percent, with natural gas in Europe
leading the way with a drop of 44 percent
and coal declining by 16.1 percent. Nonenergy prices, on the other hand, gained
1.7 percent, with food prices increasing
by 0.4 percent and fertilizer prices
declined by 6.2 percent. Further, metal
prices experienced an overall gain of 6.0
percent, with tin seeing the largest
increase at 16.5 percent, followed by
iron ore at 9.3 percent and copper at 7.9
percent. Precious metals also gained in
value, increasing by 4.9 percent.

2022), urea and DAP o -take stood at
833 thousand tonnes (39.2 percent
higher than December 2021) and 158
thousand tonnes (35.2 percent higher
than December 2021).

2.1-b Manufacturing
Amid unfavorable circumstances such
as economic shocks, the government is
taking various measures to correct
ﬁscal and current account imbalances
and controlling inﬂation. Further, the
global economic outlook also implies the
contraction of 3.7 percent in LSM during
the ﬁrst half of FY2023 (Jul-Dec).
On a YoY basis, LSM declined by 3.5
percent in December 2022, but grew by
12.4 percent over the previous month.
Four sectors, including Wearing Apparel,
Leather Products, Furniture, and others
(Football etc.), witnessed a positive
growth during the period.

2.1 Real Sector
2.1-a Agriculture
The recent estimates show that wheat
sowing for the current Rabi season
2022-23 has achieved 96 percent of the
target, covering an area of 21.94 million
acres out of the planned 22.85 million
acres. However, the productivity or yield
can be attributed to the timely
availability of quality seeds and
fertilizers, as well as a rise in agriculture
credit disbursement. These
developments bode well for meeting the
wheat production target of 28.4 million
tonnes. Furthermore, the Kissan
Package 2022 is expected to have a
positive impact on the agriculture
sector's productivity.
During Jul-Jan FY2023, the agriculture
credit disbursement increased by 28.3
percent to PKR949.9 billion from

The automobile industry experienced a
signiﬁcant decline in production and
sales during Jul-Jan FY2023 due to
import compression strategies and tight
auto ﬁnancing. Car production and sales
decreased by 38.6 percent and 43.1
percent, respectively, while Trucks and
Buses production and sales decreased
by 29.1 percent and 37.1 percent,
respectively. The total cement

dispatches also declined by 18 percent,
to 25.8 million tons during Jul-Jan
FY2023, as compared to 31.4 million tons
during the same period last year.
However, there was a marginal growth
of 1.15 percent in cement dispatches
during January 2023, with 4.0 million
tons dispatched as compared to 3.96
million tons in Jan 2022.

Fig-4: Fiscal Indicators % of GDP

2.2 Inﬂation
In January 2023, CPI stands at 27.6
percent on a year-on-year basis, which
is higher than 24.5 percent in the
previous month and 13.0 percent in
January 2022. On average, the CPI
inﬂation was recorded at 25.4 percent
during Jul-Jan FY2023, which is higher
than the 10.3 percent recorded in the
same period last year.
Major drivers contributing to the yearon-year increase in CPI include
perishable food items (61.6 percent),
transport (39.1 percent), alcoholic
beverages and tobacco (36.3 percent),
non-perishable food items (40.3 percent),
restaurants and hotels (30.1 percent),
furnishing and household equipment
maintenance (29.9 percent), housing,
water, electricity, gas and fuel (7.8
percent), and education (10.9 percent).
The Sensitive Price Indicator (SPI) for
the week ending on February 23, 2023,
increased by 2.78 percent compared to
the previous week. Prices of six items
declined, twelve items remained stable,
and thirty-three items increased.

2.3 Fiscal Performance
During the ﬁrst half of FY2022-23, total
revenues grew by 18.8 percent to reach
PKR 4,699 billion against PKR 3,956
billion in the same period of last year. The
major contribution to this growth came
from 26.4 percent increase in non-tax
collection, while tax collection has also
shown remarkable performance by
posting a growth of 17 percent during
the ﬁrst half of current ﬁscal year.
Total expenditures grew by 19.8 percent
to PKR6,382 billion in Jul-Dec FY2023

against PKR5,328 billion in the same
period last year. Current expenditures
increased by 30 percent to PKR6,061
billion in Jul-Dec FY2023 against PKR
4,676 billion in comparable period of the
last year. The bulk of this rise is stemmed
from a sharp rise in mark-up payments
which grew by 77 percent driven by
higher servicing on domestic and foreign
debt due to a higher level of interest
rates. While PSDP (Federal and
Provincial) grew by 4.5 percent during
the ﬁrst half of the current ﬁscal year.
Thus, the ﬁscal deﬁcit during Jul-Dec
FY2023 has been contained at 2.0
percent of GDP as it was in the same
period last year. While the primary
balance posted a surplus of PKR 890
billion (1.1 percent of GDP) against the
surplus of PKR 81 billion (0.1 percent of
GDP) last year.

FBR Tax Collection
FBR tax collection exceeded the target by
PKR 4.1 billion in January 2023. The
provisional net tax collection increased
by 24.8 percent in January 2023 to PKR
537.6 billion, up from PKR 430.9 billion in
the same month of the previous year.
During Jul-Jan FY2023, net tax collection
grew by 18.4 percent to PKR3,966.4
billion against PKR3,350.8 billion in the
same period last year. Domestic tax
collection grew by 21.8 percent, while
customs duty increased by 0.9 percent.

Within domestic taxes, collection from
direct tax witnessed a remarkable
performance as it increased by 48.1
percent, while sales tax grew by 1.7
percent and FED by 10.8 percent.

2.4 Monetary Sector
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC),
on January 23, 2023, increased the
policy rate by 100 basis points to 17
percent. From July 1 to January 27 of
FY2023, the money supply (M2) has only
observed a growth of 0.4% (PKR 121.5
billion), which is lower than the growth of
0.7% (PKR 175.1 billion) observed in the
same period last year. The Net Foreign
Assets (NFA) component of M2
decreased by PKR 2,014.4 billion,
compared to a decrease of PKR 545.5
billion in the previous year. On the other
hand, the Net Domestic Assets (NDA) of
the banking sector increased by PKR
2,135.9 billion, compared to an increase
of PKR 720.6 billion last year.

2.5 External Sector
The balance of payments for Jul-Jan
FY2023 shows a signiﬁcant improvement
compared to the same period last year,
with the current account deﬁcit reducing
from USD11.6 billion to USD3.8 billion.
This was largely due to a contraction in
imports, which decreased by 20.9
percent to USD33.4 billion. Exports also
declined by 7.4 percent to USD16.4 billion
during the same period. The trade deﬁcit

for Jul-Jan FY2023 was USD17.0 billion,
a reduction from USD24.6 billion last
year, as reﬂected by an improvement in
the trade balance.
In January 2023, the current account
deﬁcit further decreased to USD242
million, compared to USD2,467 million in
the same period last year, due to an
improvement in the trade balance. The
PBS report indicated that several export
commodities performed well during the
review period, including foot balls,
footwear, pharmaceutical products,
surgical goods and medical instruments,
meat and meat preparation, readymade
garments, and knitwear. These
commodities showed signiﬁcant
increases in value and quantity, ranging
from 8.2 percent to 77 percent.
In terms of imports, the main
commodities were petroleum products,
petroleum crude, liqueﬁed natural gas,
palm oil, plastic materials, iron and steel,
electrical machinery, and medicinal
products. Petroleum products were the
largest imported commodity.

2.5.1 Foreign Investment
Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) reached
USD 683.5 million during Jul-Jan FY2023
(USD 1,224.7million last year) decreasing
by 44.2 percent. FDI received from China
stands at USD 200.2 million (29.3
percent), Japan USD 133.9 million (19.6
percent), Switzerland USD 106.5 million
(15.6 percent), U.A.E. USD 83.2 million
(12.2 percent), and Netherland USD 45.0
(6.6 percent of total FDI). The power
sector attracted the highest FDI of USD
315.2 million (46.1 percent of total FDI),
Financial Business USD 224.7 million
(32.9 percent), and Oil and Gas
Explorations USD 98.4 million (14.4
percent). Foreign Public Portfolio
Investment recorded a net outﬂow of
USD 1,010.9 million compared an inﬂow
of USD 958.3 million during same period
last year. Total foreign investment during
Jul-Jan FY2023 recorded an outﬂow of
USD 341.4 million as against an inﬂow of
USD 1,875.4 million last year.

Economic Outlook
3.1 Inﬂation
Inﬂation is anticipated to remain high in
the coming months before easing out
gradually. It is expected that inﬂation will
remain around 28 to 30 percent in
coming months. The key reasons are
uncertain political and economic
environment, pass through of currency
depreciation, recent rise in energy
prices and increase in administered
prices. Although, SBP has been enacting
contractionary monetary policy, but the
inﬂationary expectation would take some
time to settle. The federal government, in
liaison with provincial governments, is
closely monitoring the demand supply

gap of essential items and taking
necessary measures to stabilize their
prices.
It is hoped that resumption of economic
stabilization program will help achieve
economic stability leading to exchange
rate stabilization and provide an
opportunity to reap the beneﬁt of falling
international commodity prices. This will
also help contain cost push inﬂation and
provide a cushion to the government to
pass through the lower commodity
prices to domestic consumers.

3.2 Agriculture

export areas, which are some how
negative as compared to historical
standards. The correlation coe cient
between the weighted average CLI in
these export areas and the cyclical
position of domestic LSM is close to 0.5.
It is therefore no surprise that LSM
output remains signiﬁcantly below its
stochastic trend, although recently some
improvement can be observed.
For January, LSM is expected to grow as
compared to the previous month, partly
due to seasonal factors. Measured on
YoY basis, LSM output may marginally
decline, mainly due to the high base
e ect in the reference period.

As of now, the favorable weather
conditions and the uptake of inputs by
the farmers are expected to play their
positive role in meeting the wheat target
of 28.4 million Tonnes. Further, the
disbursements made under the Kissan
package will have positive impact on the
agriculture productivity and overall
economic activity.

The Monthly Economic Indicator (MEI) is
based on combining monthly data of
indicators that are proven to be
correlated with GDP at constant prices.
Figure 8 presents the MEI on monthly
basis since January 2019.

3.3 Industrial Activities

LSM's cyclical pattern is positively
correlated with the cyclical position of
Pakistan's main trading partners. In
December 2022, LSM activity came in as
expected, implying that no unexpected
shocks in that month appeared.
However, the international economic
environment remains uncertain. This is
illustrated by the CLI in Pakistan's main

negative growth however there seems
some improvement in the value in the

According to Balance of Payment (BOP)

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

data, exports of goods decreased by 11.7
percent on YoY basis in the month of
January 2023 and exports of services
increased by 17.3 percent which can be
justiﬁed due to economic slowdown in
traditional export destinations of
Pakistan. Usually, the month of January
observe negative seasonal e ect that led
to decline in total exports by 4.3 percent
on MoM basis.
Similarly, import contraction trend has
continued. In January 2023, the import
of goods is decreased by 36.7 percent on
YoY basis and 7.4 percent on MoM basis.
Further, import of services declined by
47.4 percent on YoY basis. Accordingly,
imports of goods and services
decreased by 38.4 percent. Shrinking
gap between exports and imports enable
to improve trade deﬁcit in the current
ﬁscal year by 60.5 percent. Signiﬁcant
improvement in trade balance has
transmitted in the current account
deﬁcit which stood at USD 242 million as
compared USD290 million in December.
Remittance inﬂows also observed
negative seasonal e ect in the month of
January which declined to USD 1,894
million as compared USD 2,102 million in
December 2022. In the current baseline
scenario, an improvement and recovery
has been expected in remittances due to
improved situation after narrowing
down di erences between the inter-bank
and open markets subsequent allowing
adjustments of the exchange rate. As a
result, further improvement in current
account is foreseen.

3.6 Fiscal
Despite considerable challenges both at
domestic and external fronts, the ﬁscal
sector performance remained
satisfactory. The government has been
able to restrict the ﬁscal deﬁcit in terms
of GDP at the same level as last year
while primary balance remained in
surplus. The improvement is largely
attributed to government's prudent
expenditure management strategy,
which resulted in a 3.9 percent decline in
federal non-mark-up expenditures on
the back of decline in subsidies and

grant. The current policy stance has
enabled the government to increase
expenditures on vulnerable segments of
society through BISP and poverty
alleviation fund.
On the revenue side, despite slowdown in
economic activity, tax and non-tax
collection have improved. Particularly,
FBR tax collection have maintained its
growth trajectory above 18 percent
during ﬁrst seven months of current
ﬁscal year. Encouragingly, domestic tax
collection, in particular direct taxes are
growing at rapid pace indicating
e ective implementation of
administrative and enforcement
measures.
Although risks to domestic resource
mobilization e orts persist due to
economic activity and growth slowdown.
However, continuing e orts to boost tax
collection would aid in meeting the fullyear target. Similarly, recently enacted
PKR 170 billion additional taxes may
support further improving the tax
collection.

3.7 Final Remarks
The stabilization policy of the
government has been successful in
improving current account deﬁcit by 67
percent reduction during ﬁrst seven
months of the current ﬁscal year
whereas the non-markup current
expenditures are also signiﬁcantly
reduced to contain ﬁscal deﬁcit.
During the ﬁrst half of the current ﬁscal
year, interest payments on the
Government's debt signiﬁcantly
contribute to the total expenditures,
which can limit the Government's ﬁscal
space to carry out its normal operations,
investments, and social and structural
policies if the trend continues.
A couple of weeks ago, the market has
corrected to minimize the di erence
between inter-bank and open market
exchange rates whereas more recently,
it is corrected by 5 percent appreciation
of the Pakistani Rupee given its
economic fundamentals.
