Executive
Summary

P

akistan's economy is on a gradual
but promising path to recovery. The
stride of economic revival initiatives
is driving a surge in economic activity.
Positive economic signals and recovery
indicators have triggered the market
sentiment, propelling the KSE-100 index of
PSX by 33% in November, surpassing the
58199-point mark for the first time in history.
The sustained monetary policy stance and
successful IMF staff review in
Novemberdrove the market confidence.
Owing to reforms in exchange companies
and a reduction in -illicit transactions, the
exchange rate remains stable thus exerting
a positive impact on overall economic
activity.
The Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM)
sector demonstrated a positive trend for the
second consecutive month while posting a
growth of 1.0 percent in September 2023.
After several months of decline, the industry
has been on the path of recovery since
August 2023.
The stability in the exchange rate, ease in
supply disruptions due to the removal of
import restrictions, and improved dollar
liquidity contributed to this economic
upswing.
In the agriculture sector, the input situation

shows positive signs. The farm tractor
production and sales witnessed growth of
55.1 percent (17,098) and 86.8 percent
(17,296), respectively during Jul-Oct
FY2024 over the corresponding period last
year. During October 2023 the 6.8 percent
growth in urea and 122 percent in DAP
offtake compared to October 2022,
indicating a positive growth in Rabi crops.
On the fiscal front, healthy growth in
revenues outpaced the growth in
expenditure during the first quarter of
FY2024. Both tax and non-tax collection
attributed to a significant rise in total
revenues, however, a substantial increase
in non-tax collection on the back of higher
receipts from petroleum levy remained the
major source of the increase. Thus, with
healthy growth in revenues relative to
expenditures, the fiscal deficit reduced to
0.9 percent of GDP in Jul-Sep FY2024 from
1.0 percent of GDP last year. Primary
balances continued to be in surplus and
improved to Rs.416.8 billion (0.4 percent of
GDP) in Q1 FY2024 from Rs.134.7 billion
(0.2 percent of GDP) last year.
The headline inflation sustained at 26.9
percent on YoY basis in October 2023 as
compared to 26.6 percent in October 2022.
The major drivers include Food and nonalcoholic beverages, Housing, water,
electricity, gas & fuel, Transport, and
Furnishing & household equipment
maintenance. However. keeping in view the
crop cycle of perishables, the supply
pressures are expected to be relieved from
the end of November and onwards.
Moreover, the reduction of fuel prices by the
government would help further easing out
inflationary pressures.
On the external front, in Jul-Oct FY2024,
the Current Account marked a deficit of $
1.05 billion as against a deficit of $ 3.1
billion last year, largely reflecting an
improvement in the trade balance. YoY
Exports increased by 21.1 percent to $ 2.8
billion in October 2023 as compared to $
2.3 billion in September 2023, owing to
ease in import restrictions resulted in a
smooth supply of raw material for exportoriented industries. FDI reached $ 524.7

million during Jul-Oct FY2024 ($ 489.9
million last year) increased by 7.1 percent
mainly on account of Chinese investment.
MoM, remittances increased by 11.5
percent in October 2023 ($ 2.5 billion) as
compared to September 2023 ($ 2.2 billion),
and YoY it grew by 9.1 percent because of
structural reforms related to FX market and
convergence of exchange rate in interbank
and open markets.
The government expects remittances to
recover in Oct 2023, as spreads between
the interbank and open market have
reduced below 1 percent. However, global
inflation has impacted the disposable
incomes of overseas workers, resulting
slowdown across the board, particularly
Bangladesh, India, and the Philippines.
The monetary policy rate was maintained at
22 percent, owing to the significant
performance of high-frequency indicators
and improved inflation outlook.
Overall, positive economic signals and
recovery indicators steering the
improvement in the GDP outlook for the
fiscal year.

International
Performance
and Outlook
Global GDP has been observed at an
annualized pace of 3.2 percent in the first
half of 2023 compared to the second half of
2022, somewhat stronger than expected.
Growth was comparatively robust in the US
and Japan, but weak in most of Europe,
particularly Germany. Growth in China has
however lost momentum, with the initial
impetus from reopening fading and
structural problems in the property sector
continuing to weigh on domestic demand.
Contrary to global output, trade volumes
have risen more slowly than expected in the
first half of this year, with trade intensity
declining. Services trade has held up better,
helped by tourism continuing to rebound
strongly from the steep drop during

pandemic.
High-frequency activity indicators across the
largest economies present a mixed picture,
but on balance signal a loss of momentum
in the second half of 2023. Labor markets
generally remain tight, with unemployment
rates at or near multi-year low level.
During the second half of 2023, declines in
headline inflation are now helping to
improve household real disposable
incomes, but real wage losses over the past
two years and tighter financial conditions
continue to restrain consumer spending in
most advanced economies, with the US a
notable exception. Industrial production has
continued to stagnate in many economies,
despite some signs of an upturn in techrelated activity.
The impact of tighter monetary policy is
becoming increasingly visible, business and
consumer confidence have turned down,
and the rebound in China has faded.
However, in the near term, government's
fiscal expansion should help the country
achieve its 5.0 percent growth target for
2023. Global GDP growth is projected to
remain sub-par in 2023 and 2024, at 3.0
percent and 2.7 percent respectively, held
back by the macroeconomic policy
tightening needed to rein in inflation.
US economic indicators are showing
challenges and uncertainties, as
manufacturing activity is contracting,
interest costs are rising rapidly and job
creation is slowing. The employment report
for October shows 150,000 jobs were
created, but 101,000 were removed from
prior months. The growth in the labour force
pushed the unemployment rate up to 3.9
percent. The level is still low, but higher
readings could indicate the onset of a
recession.
The Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC) held the Fed's benchmark
overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%5.50% range during a decision held on
November 01, 2023. The Chair
emphasized that “deliberations were
focused solely on whether more rate hikes
are ahead, but markets interpreted the

NOVEMBER - 2023

2

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

message as saying the hiking cycle is
complete. So long as inflation does not
reignite and expect no further rate
increases, but no cuts until the second half
of 2024”. The situation is also reflected by
growth in WEI which is moving around 2.0
percent in recent months-hovering around
its target of 2.2 percent (Fig-1).
The J. P. Morgan Global Composite Output
Index decreased to 50.0 in October 2023,
the lowest reading since January.
Manufacturing output decreased for the fifth
successive month in October, as ongoing
downturns at intermediate and investment
goods more than offset further growth in the
consumer goods category. The rate of
expansion in the service sector also slowed
for the fifth month in October.

Europe remains on the precipice of
recession as the manufacturing-driven
economies led by Germany struggle with
waning domestic goods demand, higher
energy prices, and weaker growth among
some of their key Asian trading partners.
Continued services expansion has helped
to avoid recession but that growth is
expected to slow over the coming quarters.
The monthly cyclical position of Pakistan's
main export markets is also reflected
through CLI, of which US and Euro Area
economies are below their potential level in
the month of October-2023 (Fig-2).
The FAO food prices index (FFPI) averaged
120.6 points in October 2023, down by 0.7
points from September. The decline in
October was driven by a significant
decrease in the price indices for sugar,
cereals, vegetable oils, and meat, while the
index for dairy products rebounded.

Global commodity prices plummeted in
October 2023. Energy prices eased by 1.8
percent, led by coal (12.5 percent) and oil (3.4 percent). Non-energy prices declined by
1.6 percent. Food prices decreased by 1.7
percent. Beverage and raw materials eased
by 0.8 percent and 1.1 percent,
respectively. Fertilizer prices soared 2.7
percent. Metal price declined by 2.7 percent
and precious metal dropped by 0.5 percent.

2.1-a Agriculture
For the current Rabi season 2023-24, wheat
crop sowing is in progress to achieve the
area target of 8.998 million hectares for
32.12 million tonnes of production. The
input situation shows positive signs. The
farm tractor production and sales witnessed
growth of 55.1 percent (17,098) and 86.8
percent (17,296), respectively during JulOct FY2024 over the corresponding period
last year. During Jul-Oct FY2024, the

and DAP offtake stood at 459 thousand
tonnes (6.8 percent higher than October
2022) and 159 thousand tonnes (122
percent higher than October 2022),
respectively. DAP offtake seems
extraordinarily high due to record low
offtake in October 2022 because of the
occurrence of floods.
2.1-b Manufacturing
Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) grew by
0.7 percent during Jul-Sep FY 2024 against
the contraction of 1.8 percent same period
last year. In September2023, LSM
increased by 1.0 percent on YoY basis
against the contraction of 2.9 percent in the
same month last year. While on a MoM
basis, it declined by 3.6 percent in
September against the increase of 8.5
percent in August.

Metals, Machinery and Equipment, and
others (Football).
In Jul-Oct FY2024, the performance of autoindustry remains subdued due to massive
increases in inputs prices, and tightening
auto finance. Car production and sale
decreased by 52.8 percent and 47.4
percent, while Trucks & Buses production
and sale decreased by 54 percent and 45
percent. However, Tractor's production and
sale increased by 55.1 percent and 86.8
percent.
The sale of petroleum products slumped by
18 percent to 5.0 mn tons against 6.2 mn
tons in the same period last year. While in
Oct 2023, oil sales recorded at 1.3 mn tons,
down 24 percent YoY.
During Jul-Oct FY2024, total cement
dispatches (domestic and exports) were

against 13.874 million tons during the
corresponding period last year. Cement
dispatches during October 2023 were
registered at 4.007 million tons against
4.253 million tons dispatched during the
same month of the last financial year,
showing a decline of 5.8 percent. Exports
dispatches however increased by massive
97.3 percent as the volumes increased from
362,350 tons in October 2022 to 715,028
tons in October 2023. Local cement
dispatches by the industry during the month

increased to 31.4 percent in the previous
month. During Jul-Oct FY 2024, CPI stood
at 28.5 percent against 25.5 percent in the
same period last year. On a Month on
Month (MoM) basis, it increased to 1.1
percent in October 2023 compared to an
increase of 2.0 percent in the previous
month.
Major drivers contributing to the YoY
increase in CPI include Alcoholic Beverages
& Tobacco (84.6 percent), Furnishing &
Household equipment maintenance (37.1
percent), non-perishable food items (33.0
percent), Transport (31.3 percent), Housing,
Water, Electricity, gas & Fuel (20.5 percent),

November, 2023, recorded an increase of
9.95 percent as compared to previous
week. The major increase witnessed in the
prices of Gas charges. Prices of 13 items
declined, 13 items remained stable and 25
items increased.
2.3 Fiscal
The first quarter of the current fiscal year
has witnessed an improvement in fiscal
deficit primarily driven by a substantial
increase in total revenues in comparison to
expenditures. During Jul-Sep FY2024, the
fiscal deficit stood at 0.9 percent of GDP
(Rs.962.8 billion) against 1.0 percent of
GDP (Rs.819.3 billion) last year. The
primary balance posted a surplus of
Rs.416.8 billion (0.4 percent of GDP)
against a surplus of Rs.134.7 billion (0.2
percent of GDP) during the period under
review.
Total revenues registered a notable growth
of 33.2 percent, reaching Rs. 2685.8 billion
from Rs. 2017.0 billion last year. Non-tax
collection witnessed an impressive growth
of 99.6 percent to Rs. 468.8 billion against
Rs. 234.9 billion in the corresponding period
last year. The substantial increase in non-

tax collection can be attributed to higher
receipts from petroleum levy, passport fees,
royalties on oil/gas, and mark-up (PSEs &
others), etc. Tax collection on the other
hand increased by 24.4 percent to Rs.
2216.9 billion against Rs. 1782.1 billion last
year. According to the latest available data,
Jul-Oct FY2024, FBR tax collection grew by
27.9 percent and stood at Rs. 2748.4 billion
against Rs.2149.0 billion last year.
Encouragingly, the tax collection has
surpassed the target by Rs.66 billion.
Domestic tax collection grew by 30.2
percent to stand at Rs.2404.7 billion in JulOct FY2024 against Rs.1847.5 billion last
year. Within total tax collection, direct taxes
grew by 38.4 percent while indirect taxes
increased by 20.5 percent on the back of a
sharp rise in revenues from FED.
Total expenditure stood at Rs.3648.6 billion
during the first quarter of FY2024 against
Rs.2836.3 billion in the same period of last
year, thus growing by 28.6 percent. Current
expenditures grew by 25.0 percent to reach
Rs.3172.6 billion against Rs.2538.1 billion
last year. Within total current, mark-up
payments experienced a substantial surge
of 44.6 percent, primarily attributable to a
higher policy rate. Meanwhile, the growth in
non-mark-up spending remained restricted
to 13.2 percent. The expenditures under the
running of civil government and pensions
remained the major contributor in
stimulating the growth of non-mark-up
spending, while expenditures on subsidies
and grants to others witnessed a substantial

decline during the first quarter of the current
fiscal year.
2.4 Monetary Sector
In monetary policy decision held on 30th
October 2023, MPC has maintained the
policy rate at 22 percent. The decision was
based on observed significant improvement
in high-frequency indicators including crop
performance, revival in the LSM sector and
aligned indicators, fiscal consolidation, and
external sector stability. The MPS highlights
that inflation will 'decline significantly in
October, owing to downward adjustments in
fuel prices, easing prices of some major
food commodities, and a favorable base
effect'. Accordingly, in October, CPI inflation
clocked in at 26.9 percent on a YoY basis
as compared to 31.4 percent in Sep-2023.
The MPC reaffirmed its earlier assessment
that inflation will decline substantially from
the second half of FY2024, barring any
major adverse developments.

($ 2.5 billion) as compared to September
2023 ($ 2.2 billion),and YoY it grew by 9.1
percent because of structural reforms
related to exchange company and
consequently convergence in exchange
rate in interbank and open markets.
Furthermore, the recently signed MoU
between the Arab Monetary Fund and the
SBP would increase cross-border
remittances by reducing costs and

The Food and Agriculture Organization's
food price index, which tracks the most
globally traded food commodities, averaged
120.6 points in October, 2023 down from

decline of 0.7 points. The October reading
was the lowest since March 2021.
Domestically, the high base effect would

NOVEMBER - 2023

7

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

provide a little solace to inflation growth in
the upcoming months. The spike witnessed
in weekly SPI recorded on 16th November,
2023 is primarily contributed by increase in
Gas charges (up to 3.3719 MMBTU) WoW
and YoY at 480 percent and 1109 percent,
respectively. However, this increase in gas
prices will not impact CPI to much extent.
National CPI inflation comprises Urban and
Rural baskets. Gas charges are included
only in the Urban CPI basket with a weight
of 1.0807. So, the increase in gas prices will
have a limited impact on the national CPI
inflation as compared to the weekly SPI.
Keeping in consideration, the crop cycle of
perishables, the supply pressures are
expected to be relieved by end November
onwards. Moreover, the reduction of fuel
prices by the government would help further
easing out inflationary pressures.
In view of the above, inflation is anticipated
to remain low and expected to remain
around 26.5-27.5 percent in November
2023 and further ease out to 25.5-26.5
percent in December 2023.
3.2 Agriculture
There is an uptick in farm input utilization
and a better price of wheat will augur well in
achieving the production target of wheat
given favourable weather conditions.
3.3 Industrial activity
The LSM cycle usually follows the cyclical
movements in the main trading partners, but
since it is focused on the main industrial
sectors and not on total GDP, it is
somewhat more volatile than the cyclical
component of GDP in Pakistan's main
export markets. The aggregate CLI in the
main export markets has improved and
reached its potential level. The cyclical LSM
pattern for the month of September shows
convergence with that of its main trading
partners.
During Jul-Oct FY2024, total cement
dispatches (domestic and exports) were
15.892 million tons which is 14.6 percent
more than 13.874 million tons in the
corresponding period of last year. Similarly,
tractor's production and sales increased by

55.1 percent and 86.8 percent. All these
positive indicators bode well for the
prospects of the LSM sector in the
upcoming months, especially from
November 2023 onwards.
Overall Economic Activity
The Monthly Economic Indicator (MEI) is
developed as a tool to distribute the past
annual GDP numbers, reported by the PBS,
on a monthly/quarterly basis, and to
nowcast GDP growth for the FY in which the
National Accounts are not yet available on
the same frequency. The figure presents the
MEI on a monthly basis since July 2019, it
should be noted that some of the data

well as primary income balance, it will be
reflected in the current account balance.

The MEI continued to be positive in October
2023 driven by notable improvement in key
indicators of economic activity. Better
performance of the LSM sector fueled by
positive trends in high-frequency data, a
steady uptick in imports, and improvement
in CLI of Pakistan's major export markets
are providing impetus to overall economic
activity. Furthermore, the inflationary
pressures are receding on the back of a
decline in international commodity prices,
better crop outlook, and exchange rate
stability. With all these positive
developments anticipating further
improvement in domestic economic
activities, the MEI is expected to remain
positive throughout the ongoing fiscal year.

3.5 External
According to BOP data, October imports of
goods and services were at $ 5.2 billion,
higher than $ 4.8 billion in September and
marginally lower than the $ 5.4 billion in
October 2023. The soothed international oil
prices, stable exchange rate in October
somewhat offset by expansion in economic
activities, contributed to an increase in
imports. Given these recent dynamics and
under unchanged policy assumptions,
imports would remain at around the current
observed levels in the coming months.
Exports of goods reached $2.8 billion, the
highest value observed after June 2022. As
a result, export of goods and services
posted significant growth of 10.5 and 17.8
percent on MoM and YoY basis,
respectively. In the coming months, it is
expected that exports will continue to
observe its momentum with assumptions of
growth in the LSM sector and encouraging
foreign demand. As a result, the trade
balance in goods and services has
marginally deteriorated on MoM basis but
improved significantly on YoY basis.
Remittance inflows have touched the $ 2.5
billion mark and observed positive YoY
growth after 13 months. It is expected that it
will remain at the current level in the coming
months. Considering the improvement in all
other components of secondary income, as

The fiscal performance in Q1-FY2024
reflects a positive trajectory, characterized
by a notable surge in total revenues relative
to expenditures. As a result, the fiscal deficit
reduced from 1.0 percent of GDP recorded
in Jul-Sep FY2023 to 0.9 percent of GDP
during the current period. The surplus in
the primary balance has improved,
attributed to the restricted growth in nonmarkup expenditures.
Similarly, the pace of growth in FBR tax
collection remained robust sustained by
various tax policy and administrative
initiatives. Encouragingly, this marks the 4th
consecutive month in which FBR achieved
the revenue collection target. Despite better
fiscal accounts during the first quarter of the
current fiscal year, higher mark-up
payments may put significant pressure on
the expenditure side. However, it is
expected that effective fiscal management
through robust growth in revenues and a
cautious expenditure approach will navigate
potential challenges and maintain positive
momentum in the fiscal sector.
3.7 Final Remarks
During the first four months of FY2024,
performance of the overall economy is
encouraging as the MEI continued to be
positive in October 2023 driven by a notable
improvement in key indicators of economic
activity. Better performance of the LSM
sector fueled by positive trends in highfrequency data, a steady uptick in imports,
and improvement in CLI of Pakistan's major
export markets are providing impetus to
overall economic activity. All these gains are
also reflected in improved fiscal and
external accounts position.

The Government's execution of the FY2024
budget with continued adjustment of energy
prices, and renewed flows into the foreign

and external pressures. Furthermore, the
inflationary pressures are receding and the
outlook has improved Inflation is expected
to decline over the coming months amid
receding supply constraints and modest
demand. With all these positive
developments, further improvement in
domestic economic activities is anticipated
in upcoming months.
