Executive
Summary

T

he IMF has revised global economic
growth modestly higher, yet lower
than 2022 due to weak performance
in advanced economies. According to the
latest World Economic Outlook (WEO),
global growth is expected to decelerate to
3.0 percent in 2023 from 3.5 percent in
2022. The inflation rate is projected to
decline globally, but tight monetary policy
stance will continue at global level to
address the problem of inflation which is
likely to deteriorate global growth prospects
further. This situation raises the cost of
external borrowing for the developing
countries and created currency stability
predicament. Therefore, developing
countries are facing the supply-side and
exchange rate shock whereas there is
marginal space for the policymakers to deal
the short-term issues.
In Pakistan, the real sector, agriculture and
manufacturing experienced mixed trends. In
agriculture sector, cotton arrivals increased
due to the improved seed quality. It is
expected that the recent year's target of
12.77 million bales will be achieved with the
use of improved quality of seed in both
Sindh and Punjab. While, Large Scale
Manufacturing (LSM) has faced challenges
due to supply chain disruptions and policy
stances. Key sectors such as automobiles,
petroleum, and cement have witnessed
varying levels of growth and decline.

Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation has
risen on a year-on-year (YoY) basis, and
there are up-down fluctuations in inflation
rates on a month-on-month (MoM) basis. In
the month of July 2023, CPI inflation
increased to 28.3 percent on YoY basis as
compared to 24.9 percent in July 2022
whereas it increased to 29.4 percent in the
previous month.
Pakistan's fiscal year 2023 witnessed
increase in total expenditures, driven by
higher current spending. Development
expenditure rose due to increased federal
Public Sector Development Program
(PSDP). Revenues increased due to higher
tax collection, with growth in both domestic
taxes and customs duty.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has
maintained the policy rate, considering
improved economic certainty, external
sector stability, and fiscal consolidation
efforts. Money supply (M2) experienced
negative growth, and foreign exchange
reserves increased.
The current account deficit decreased by
35.8 percent and stood at $ 809 million
during July 2023 as against $ 1.3 billion last
year, owing to improvement in trade
balance.

International
Performance
and Outlook
According to WEO-July 2023, global growth
is expected to remain at 3.0% both in 2023
and 2024, lower than 3.5% in 2022. While
the forecast for 2023 is modestly higher
than predicted (2.8% for 2023) in the April
2023-WEO. The rise in central bank policy
rates to fight inflation continues to weigh on
economic activity. The growth in advanced
economies would decline from 2.7% in 2022
to 1.5% in 2023 and remain restrained at
1.4% in 2024. The Euro area is still
recovering from war induced rise in gas
price - would deteriorate profoundly. On the
contrary, emerging markets and developing
economies is forecasted to grow by 4.1% in
AUGUST- 2023

2023 and 2024 from 3.1% in 2022. Global
inflation is projected to decline from 8.7
percent in 2022 to 6.8% in 2023 and 5.2%
in 2024.
The Fed has raised the federal funds rate
by 5.25 percentage points since March
2022, with policymakers approving rate
increases at 11 of the last 12 meetings in a
sequence of actions meant to discourage
borrowing and spending, and slow both the
economy and the pace of price increases.
CPI rose at a 3.2% annual rate in July,
which was a slight increase over June's 3%.
But underlying price trends showed
continued slowing.
According to Federal Reserve Bank of New
York's July 2023 “Survey of Consumer
Expectations”, illustrates that median
inflation expectations decreased across all
three horizons, declining to 3.5% at the
short-term horizon, 2.9%at the medium and
long term horizons. Year-ahead price
growth expectation for food, medical care
and rent declined to their lowest levels since
early 2021. Households' perceptions about
their current financial situations and
expectations for the future improved.
After second quarter, outlook for US
economy for 2023 has improved. Both JP
Morgan and Bank of America raises US
economic growth estimate-no longer
expects 2023 recession. GDP growth will
grow by 2.0%, up from a previous forecast
value of 1.5%. US economy grew faster
than expected in the second quarter as a
resilient labor market supported consumer
spending, while businesses boosted
investment in equipment and built more
factories. This also reflected through growth
in WEI which is currently moving around
2.0% (Fig-1).
The J. P. Morgan Global Composite Output
Index decreased to 51.7 in July 2023, from
52.7 in June 2023. The global economic
growth eases at start of third quarter as
slowdown in new orders continues. The rate
of expansion in output and new orders
weakened, as manufacturers sector
contraction was accompanied by a further
slowdown at service providers.

Within PMI data, China, UK, and US shows
moderate expansion in output for the month
of July against deterioration observed in
eurozone. This growth pattern also reflected
through CLI position of Pakistan's main
exports market for July-2023 (Fig-2).
The FAO food prices index (FFPI) averaged
123.9 points in July 2023, up by 1.5 points
from June. The rebound decline in July was
driven by a significant increase in the price
indices for vegetable oils, partially offset by
a considerable decline in the sugar along
with a marginal reduction in cereals, dairy
and meat.
Global commodity prices soared in July
2023. Energy prices increased by 6 percent,
led by natural gas U.S 17 percent and oil
7.8 percent. Non-energy prices rose by 0.7
percent. Food prices gained 0.9 percent.
Beverage eased by 1.8 percent while raw
materials changed little. Fertilizer prices
soared 5.3 percent. Metal price increased
0.4 percent led by tin 5.6 percent. Precious
metal rose by 0.9 percent.

Association (PCGA), the cotton arrivals in
factories reached to 2.12 million bales
(Punjab: 0.64 million bales & Sindh: 1.48
million bales) as on 15th August 2023.The
improved & pest resilient quality seeds of
cotton has been used both in Punjab and
Sindh which will contribute to achieve
current year's target of 12.77 million bales.
To develop agriculture sector, under Kissan
package government is providing subsidy
for interest-free loans for subsistence
farmers in flood affected areas, PM's Youth
Business and Agriculture Loan Scheme
(PMYBALS), Markup Subsidy & Risk
Sharing scheme for Farm Mechanization
(MSRSSFM), and Interest Free Loans to
subsistence farmers in the flood affected
areas.

During July FY2024, the agriculture credit
disbursement recorded at Rs 151 billion as
compared to Rs 112 billion last year
showing increase of 35.1 percent. During
July 2023, Urea offtake was recorded at
629 thousand tonnes showing an increase
of 36.0 percent while DAP offtake stood at
113 thousand tonnes; increased by 67.7
percent over July 2022.

2.1-b Manufacturing
LSM witnessed a decline of 10.26 percent
during FY2023 due to supply chain
disruptions, inflationary pressures and
resultant hike in input prices, and continued
contractionary policy stance at the domestic
level to correct the imbalances. On a YoY
basis, LSM nosedived by 14.96 percent in
June 2023 and while on MoM basis, it
inched up by 0.98 percent. During the
period, 4 sectors witnessed positive growth
which includes, Wearing apparel, Leather
Products, Furniture, and others (Football).
In July FY2024, the performance of autoindustry remains subdued due to massive
increases in inputs prices, and tightening
auto finance. Car production and sale
decreased by 75.7percent and 64.3percent,
while Trucks & Buses production and sale
decreased by 72.3 percent and
28.8percent, respectively.
The sale of petroleum products declined by
6 percent in July FY2024 to 1.35 mn tons
against 1.44 mn tons in the same period
last year. While on MoM basis, it remained
stable.

The SPI for the week ended on 31 August
2023, recorded an increase of 0.54 percent
as compared to previous week. Prices of 08
items declined, 23 items remained stable

2.3 Fiscal
The fiscal year 2023 witnessed a significant
rise in total expenditure that grew by 21.5
percent to Rs.16155 billion against
Rs.13295 billion in FY2022. Higher
expenditures were realized mainly due to a
26.6 percent increase in current spending.
In absolute terms, it stood at Rs.14583
billion in FY2023 against Rs.11521 billion
recorded in FY2022. The increase in current
expenditure is largely attributed to 83.2
percent rise in markup payments while nonmarkup spending was restricted to 5
percent. Development expenditure grew by
17.1 percent largely due to a 62.8 percent

rise in federal PSDP during FY2023.
On the revenue side, total revenues grew
by 19.9 percent to reach Rs.9634 billion in
FY2023 from Rs.8035 billion in FY2022.
Within total, tax revenues (federal and
provincial) grew by 15.7 to Rs.7819 billion in
FY2023 as compared to Rs.6755 billion in
FY2022. During FY2023, FBR tax collection
grew by 16.7 percent to Rs.7169 billion
against Rs.6143 billion in the same period
of last year. According to the latest available
data, in Jul FY2024, FBR tax collection not
only grew by 17.5 percent but also
surpassed the collection target by Rs.4
billion. Within total tax collection, revenues
from domestic taxes grew by 19 percent
while from customs duty 9 percent growth
has been registered.
On the other hand, FY2023 registered a
significant rise in non-tax collection largely
attributed to higher receipts from petroleum
levy followed by markup (PSEs & others)
and Royalties on oil/gas. Overall, non-tax
collection grew by 42 percent to Rs.1815
billion in FY2023 against Rs.1280 billion in
FY2022.
Thus, FY2023 witnessed a fiscal deficit of
7.7 percent of GDP (Rs.6521 billion) against
7.9 percent of GDP (Rs.5260 billion) in the
last year. Similarly, the primary deficit was
restricted to 0.8 percent of GDP in FY2023
against 3.1 percent of GDP recorded in
FY2022 mainly due to limited growth in nonmarkup spending.

several reasons included: seasonal factors
post-Eid decline, political and economic
uncertainty. MoM, remittances decreased

million), EU 14.0 percent ($ 283.6 million),
Canada 1.8 percent ($ 36.9 million), and
other countries 6.5 percent ($ 132.4 million).
The decline is also attributed to global
economic slowdown as higher inflation in
developed countries has led to higher cost
of living abroad, thus reducing the surplus
funds that could be sent back to homeland
as remittances.

Economic
Outlook

3.1 Inflation
The international commodity price outlook is
promising and is expected to offset the
negative impact of local currency
depreciation in Pakistan and help lower the
pressure on imported commodities' prices.
Moreover, the FAO Food Price Index, which
tracks international prices of the most
globally traded food commodities, stood at
123.9 points in July 2023, showing a
decrease of 11.8 percent as compared to
July 2022. Four of the FAO's five food subindices - cereals, meat, dairy, and vegetable
oils - recorded a decline of 14.5 percent, 5.1
percent, 20.6 percent, and 23.1 percent,
respectively, which would be instrumental to
ease out domestic prices.
Domestically, the high base effect would
provide a little solace to inflation growth
however, the two massive fuel price hikes
witnessed in the month of August 2023 and
upward adjustment in energy tariffs, would
strain the inflationary pressures in the
coming months. Nevertheless, the expected
lagged impact of accumulated monetary
tightening, fiscal consolidation efforts of the
government and better growth outlook
would help easing out inflationary pressures
in later half of FY 2024.
In view of above, inflation is anticipated to
remain around 29 to 31 percent in August
2023. The two times raise in fuel prices

drives a broad-based increase by impacting
the transportation cost.

3.2 Agriculture
The extension of Kissan Package-2022 will
certainly have positive impact on agriculture
sector which in turn raise the livelihood of
the farmers and it will contribute in
achieving the targeted growth for FY2024.

3.3 Industrial activity
The LSM cycle usually follows the cyclical
movements in the main trading partners, but
since it is focused on the main industrial
sectors and not on total GDP, it is
somewhat more volatile than the cyclical
component of GDP in Pakistan's main
export markets. The aggregate CLI in the
main export markets remained relatively
stable showing no significant upward
movement. As expected, the cyclical LSM
pattern in the month of June remained
negative due to the high base effect and
deterred economic environment. However,
for the month of July, the pressure is
expected to ease out on the back of
significant rebound in cement dispatches
indicating a rise in construction activities
and the removal of import restrictions.

3.4 Overall Economic Activity
The Monthly Economic Indicator (MEI) is
developed as a tool to distribute the past
annual GDP numbers, as reported by the
PBS, on a monthly/quarterly basis, and to

AUGUST- 2023

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

nowcast on that same frequency GDP
growth for the FY in which the National
Accounts are not yet available. Fig-8
presents the MEI on a monthly basis since
January 2019. It should be noted that some
of the data underlying the July MEI are still
provisional and may be revised next month.
The MEI calculated for July 2023 shows the
revival of economic fundamentals, as it
recorded positive growth after Feb-2023. It
lays the foundation of inclusive growth and
is expected to be positive throughout the
current fiscal to achieve the targeted growth
of 3.5 percent.

3.5 External
BoP data for the month of July-FY2024
shows that exports of goods and services
continued to observe last year's trend and
declined by 3.2 and 1.4 percent,
respectively, on YoY and MoM basis.
However, imports have changed their
behavior after lifting the restriction, which
increased by 29.8 percent on MoM basis in
the month of July-FY2024. This has been
translated in trade deficit of goods and
services, widened from $1.18 billion in June
2023 to $ 2.4 billion in July 2023. Similarly,
remittances decreased by 19.3 and 7.3
percent on YoY and MoM basis
respectively. As a result, the current
account turns to deficit of $ 809 million
against surplus of $ 504 million in June
2023.

For the outlook, imports will gradually
increase in next months, to increase in
economic activities. However, exports are
facing both global and domestic headwinds
which may hinder growth in coming months.
Taking other factors into account, current
account will remain around the same level
observed in July 2023.

3.6 Fiscal
The fiscal sector remained under significant
pressure during FY2023 due to various
factors. On the expenditure side, massive
floods raised expenditure needs for urgent
relief and rehabilitation activities.
Additionally, an increase in the policy rate
triggered higher markup payments, putting
pressure on overall expenditures. On the
revenue side, the import compression policy
during FY2023 substantially reduced the
revenues from import-related taxes.
Furthermore, a considerable decline in LSM
caused overall industrial activity to
deteriorate. All these factors collectively
took a significant toll on overall tax
collection. Consequently, the fiscal deficit
has been recorded at 7.7 percent of GDP
considerably high from its level set in
budget 2022-23.
Going forward, in FY2024, the budget
strategy 2023-24 prioritized fiscal
consolidation effort to meet the existing
challenges on both revenue and
expenditure sides. The objective is to
achieve a primary surplus of 0.4 percent
and reduce the fiscal deficit to 6.5 percent
of GDP in FY2024. To achieve these
targets the priorities are geared towards
effective resource mobilization through
various tax measures and expenditure
control by adopting austerity measures.
While pursuing fiscal consolidation, the
government is committed to safeguarding
vulnerable segments of society by
expanding social safety nets and ensuring
targeted subsidies. These measures would
be supportive in mitigating the effect of
policy changes for lower-income individuals.

3.7 Final Remarks
In FY2023, external sector stabilized as
current account deficit contained to $ 2.4

AUGUST- 2023

8

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

billion against $ 17.5 billion in FY2022. On
the other hand, fiscal sector remained under
tremendous pressure and fiscal deficit
reached to 7.7 percent of GDP. Similarly
industrial activity suppressed as LSM
observed negative growth of 10.26 percent.
Despite this, higher and inclusive growth
target of 3.5 percent for FY2024 with some
facilitation measures have commenced

some dividends in July 2023 and FY2024
started with some encouraging signs and
expectations - MEI observed positive
