Execu ve
Summary

A

lthough the world stands on the
edge of slow growth along with
high inﬂation but energy and
food prices are substantially lower than
what they were at their peaks. Data
released by the Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations
revealed eleven straight monthly price
decline which pushed food prices down
by 19 percent from a peak last March.
However, new export restrictions from
some countries could soar prices again.
Furthermore, oil prices are ﬂuctuating
somehow after Brent oil prices dipped
below 72 dollar per barrel amid ongoing
quivers in ﬁnancial markets.
For Rabi season 2022-23, the harvest of
wheat crop has been started in Sindh
while it is going to be harvested in Punjab
by the end of March. Government has
increased the wheat support price from
Rs 2,200 to Rs 3,900 per 40 kg for Rabi
2022-23 to incentivize the farmers. LSM
performance remained under pressure
and witnessed a contraction of 4.4
percent during Jul-Jan FY2023 owing to
increasingly synchronized policy stance
to correct the imbalances, supply chain
disruptions and recessionary global
pressure. CPI inﬂation during Jul-Feb FY
2022-23 recorded at 26.2 percent
compared to 10.5 percent during the
same period last year.
The ﬁscal deﬁcit during ﬁrst seven
month of current ﬁscal year has been
contained to 2.3 percent of GDP against
2.8 percent of GDP last year. The primary
balance has posted a surplus of Rs. 945
billion during Jul-Jan FY2023 against the
deﬁcit of Rs 210 billion last year. Total
expenditures grew by 10 percent, largely
driven by expenditures on markup
payments which grew 73 percent due to
higher servicing on domestic and foreign
debts. The net provisional tax collection

grew by 18.2 percent to Rs 4,493.3 billion
during Jul-Feb FY2023 against Rs
3,802.1 billion in the comparable period
of last year. The ﬁscal consolidation
e orts have been reﬂected in attaining
surplus in primary balance and
containing ﬁscal deﬁcit despite
exponential increase in borrowing cost.
st
rd
Further, during 1 July – 03 March,
FY23 money supply (M2) showed meager
growth of 1.9 percent.
The current account deﬁcit shrank to
USD 74 million in February 2023 as
against USD 230 million in the previous
month. The Current Account posted a
deﬁcit of USD 3.9 billion for Jul-Jan
FY2023 as against a deﬁcit of USD 12.1
billion last year decline by 68 percent
which signiﬁcantly reduced the external
ﬁnancing requirement.

Interna onal
Performance and
Outlook
Global growth prospects at the end of
ﬁrst quarter of 2023 have improved
since December, 2022. This improvement
is due to China's reopening, a material
easing of the European natural gas crisis
and resilience in US consumer demand.
Since start of the Russia-Ukraine
conﬂict, this is the ﬁrst upward world
growth forecast. Fitch forecast world
growth at 2.0% in 2023, revised up from
1.4% in the December 2022. This was
mainly due to China's 2023 growth
forecast to 5.2% from 4.1%, eurozone
growth to 0.8% from 0.2% and US growth
to 1.0% from 0.2%. However, lowered
global growth in 2024 would reﬂect the
lagged impact of rapid Fed and ECB
interest rate hikes. The European gas
crisis has eased sharply in recent
months with gas supply holding up,
inventories improving relative to
seasonal norms and wholesale prices
are falling signiﬁcantly. This is helping

headline inﬂation pressures.

Chinese authorities this month
announced a growth target of around
5%. China's retail sales growth for the
ﬁrst two months reported of the year
matched expectations, while real estate
investment fell further. Industrial
production for the January-February
period rose by 2.4%, less than the 2.6%
forecasts. Exports, a major driver of
China's economy, have slowed sharply.
Demand from major trading partners
such as the U.S. has fallen as those
economies face surging inﬂation and
slower growth.
US Department of Commerce reported
the estimate for 2022's fourth quarter
real GDP annual growth rate as 2.7
percent, which is somewhat weaker than
the third quarter's 3.2 percent. The
economic activity hit hard by high
interest rates and weak housing activity.
Some comfort observed in inﬂation
pressure. The fourth quarter GDP price
index increased at an annual rate of 3.2
percent compared the third quarter's 4.8
percent and the second quarter's 7.3
percent. Surprisingly, given the Fed's
interest rate run-up, 517,000 workers
were added to US payrolls in January;
the average for 2022 was 401,000.
The US economy proved resilient to start
the new year, marked by steady
consumer spending and stabilizing
manufacturing activity. However, the
outlook going forward is less optimistic,
amid heightened uncertainty, surveys did
not expect economic conditions to
improve much in the months ahead, Fed
Beige Book reports anecdotal
information collected by the Fed's 12
regional banks during February. US
economic situation is observing low
optimism which is also reﬂected through
continuous declining trend in WEI during
February (Fig-1).
The J.P.Morgan Global Composite Output
Index increased to 52.1 in
February2023, from 49.7 in January
2023, on account of increase in global
output and new orders after seven

months in February, 2023. The upturn in
output was led by the services sector
reinforced by the ﬁrst expansion of
manufacturing production since last
July. The major growth was registered in
Asia as China and Japan both returned
to expansions for the second successive
month. The reviving performance of the
global economy also breathed life into
the trends in business conﬁdence and
job creation. Positive sentiment rose to
its highest level in a year, improving at
both manufacturers and service
providers.
The February PMIs provide a convincing
signal that the global expansion is
gathering steam early in the year. The
global composite output PMI rose by 2.4
points to an eight-month high of 52.1 in
February, consistent with global GDP
growing at its potential pace. With
reduced recession risks, improving
supply chains, and the reopening of the
Chinese economy is likely to boost
demand in the immediate future, further
gains in output are expected in the
coming months.
The composite leading indicator (CLI) is
designed to provide early signals of
turning points in business cycles
showing ﬂuctuation of the economic
activity around its long-term potential
level.

as well as in the Euro area as a whole,
including Germany, France and Italy. The

motor vehicles and share prices.
The FAO food prices index (FFPI)
averaged 129.8 points in February 2023,
marginally down 0.6 points from
January, marking the eleventh
consecutive monthly declines. The
decrease in the index in February was
mainly due to sharp decline in

For Rabi season 2022-23, the harvest of
wheat crop has been started in Sindh
while it is going to be harvested in Punjab
by the end of March. The kisan package
is expected to bode up the crop
productivity in the aftermath of ﬂood
damages. However, the climatic changes
will play a critical role in achieving the
target. More importantly, government
has increased the wheat support price
from Rs 2,200 to Rs 3,900 per 40 kg to
incentivize the farmers.
During Jul-Feb FY2023, the agriculture
credit disbursement increased by 28.5
percent to Rs 1073.5 billion from Rs

while it grew by 1.5 percent over the
previous month. During the period, 4
sectors witnessed positive growth which
includes, Wearing apparel, Leather

The performance of auto-industry also
remains subdued due to massive
increases in inputs prices, tightening
auto ﬁnance, and import restrictions.

billion (-0.3 percent of GDP) last year.
The improvement in ﬁscal indicators
have been realized on account of
signiﬁcant rise in net federal revenues
that outpaced the growth in total
expenditure. During Jul-Jan FY2023, net
federal revenues increased by 30
percent to reach Rs 2798 billion against
Rs 2152 billion in the same period of last
year. On the other hand, total
expenditures grew by only 10 percent to
Rs 5058 billion during Jul-Jan FY2023 as
compared to Rs 4592 billion last year.
Expenditures on markup payments grew
by 73 percent due to higher servicing on
domestic and foreign debt as a result of
higher interest rates. On the other hand,
non-markup expenditures reduced by 26
percent owing to signiﬁcant decline in
subsidies and grants.

FBR Tax Collection
The net provisional tax collection grew
by 18.2 percent to Rs 4493.3 billion
during Jul-Feb FY2023 against Rs 3802.1

Direct tax collection has witnessed a
substantial increase with growth of 48
percent while the indirect tax collection
grew by 2.1 percent during Jul-Feb
FY2023.The government's strategy of
making taxation progressive and
equitable by shifting the tax burden to
society's wealthiest and a uent groups
has resulted in a robust pace of
development in direct tax collection.

Economic
Outlook
3.1 Inﬂation
Inﬂation is expected to stay at elevated
level owing to market frictions caused by
relative demand and supply gap of
essential items, exchange rate
depreciation and recent upward
adjustment of administered prices of
petrol and Diesel. Due to the lagged
e ect of ﬂoods, the production losses
especially of major agriculture crops has
not yet been fully recovered.
Consequently, the shortage of essential
items has emerged and persisted.
Inﬂation may further jack up as a result
of second round e ect.
Another potential reason of rising price
level is the political and economic
uncertainty. The economic distress
resulting from delay of stabilization
program has exacerbated the economic
uncertainty due to which inﬂationary
expectations have remained strong.
Despite SBP's contractionary monetary
policy the inﬂationary expectations are
not settling down. Moreover, the bulk
buying during the month of Ramadan
may cause demand supply gap and result
into prices of essential items to escalate.
However, the government is well
cognizant of this and have already taken
on board all provincial governments to
ensure smooth supply of essential items.
Inﬂation in March may remain in upper
bound as observed in the month of
February. Recent monetary policy
restrictions and e orts towards ﬁscal
consolidation along with the
administrative, policy and relief
measures are expected to ease out the
inﬂationary pressure by the end of the
current ﬁscal year.

3.2 Agriculture
Wheat production largely depends on the
prevailing climatic conditions. As
witnessed last year, delay in rains and
early heat waves are expected to
adversely impact the wheat production.
According to Pakistan Met O ce the
country might witness di erent spells of
heatwaves within upcoming months of
April and May, 2023.

3.3 Industrial Activities
LSM's cyclical pattern is well positively
correlated with the cyclical position of
Pakistan's main trading partners. In
January, LSM activity came in marginally
below expectations. Although the CLI in
Pakistan's main export areas remains
below its neutral level, some stabilization
in its current cyclical condition seems to
appear in recent months. This may bode
well for domestic industrial production.
But current monetary restriction and
ﬁscal consolidation, both required to
bring external and internal balance may
cause further short run pain to the
domestic economy, which also translates
into domestic industrial production
below its neutral capacity level. YoY
growth of LSM is expected to remain
negative in February while MoM LSM is
expected to remain positive.

For the month of March, it is expected
that exports and imports will remain at
current level due to slow growth in the
major trading partners and contained

ﬁscal consolidation in order to reduce
the overall ﬁscal deﬁcit through a
combination of expenditure management
and revenue increase. These measures
are paying o in the form of improved
ﬁscal accounts. The ﬁscal deﬁcit has
been reduced to 2.3 percent of GDP
during Jul-Jan FY2023, down from 2.8
percent of GDP in the same period
previous year, while the primary balance
is in surplus due to signiﬁcant decline in
non-markup expenditures. On revenue
side, FBR tax collection currently

The ﬁscal consolidation is at the top of
government's stabilization agenda in
order to tackle sizeable ﬁscal deﬁcit.

overall ﬁscal deﬁcit as a percent of GDP.

3.7 Final Remarks
Despite challenges and uncertainties,
economy is showing continuous signs of
resilience as depicted through contained
ﬁscal and current account deﬁcit during
the current FY.
Furthermore, Pakistan is currently
confronted with a shortage in external

liquidity. Through demand management
policies, government is trying to limit the
current account deﬁcit, which will not
transfer further pressure on dwindling
reserves. Moreover, the Government is
ﬁrmly inclined to successfully complete
the IMF's EFF program, which includes
necessary policy measures and will
bring additional relief to the ﬁnancial
account of the balance of payments. The
policy measures are intended to bring
expenditures more in line with the
income generated within the country. At
ﬁscal front, Government is pursuing
ﬁscal consolidation in order to reduce
the overall ﬁscal deﬁcit through
expenditure management, austerity
measures, and revenue mobilization.
