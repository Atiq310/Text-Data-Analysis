lobal growth is projected to slow
down significantly in 2023, before a
tepid recovery in 2024. The deceleration is
attributed to persistent inflationary
pressures, consequent tight monetary
policy, and a rising number of restrictions on
international trade that would lead to
geopolitical and economic fragmentation.
Global inflation is projected to gradually
edge down as growth decelerates, labor
demand in many economies softens, and
commodity prices remain stable.
Despite many challenges faced by
Pakistan's economy on external and
domestic fronts, the real sector showed
resilience as the agriculture sector
experienced positive growth while the
percentage decline in Large Scale
Manufacturing was contained to single digit
during the first ten months of the current
fiscal year. Moreover, targets for Kharif
crops seem to be easily achieved on
account of favourable weather and
supportive government policies.
Inflation rate remained high in the first
eleven months of this fiscal year owing to
currency depreciation, global price hike and
supply side effects of high cost of
borrowing. However, it is projected to ease
in the month of June.
Fiscal consolidation efforts of the
government remained fruitful as primary
balance witnessed a surplus, while the
overall fiscal deficit as percentage of GDP
decreased in the first ten months of
outgoing fiscal year as compared to same
period last year. Further, SBP has
unchanged policy rate in its meeting held on
June 12, 2023.
Policies to contain external sector remained
effective as current account deficit
significantly reduced in the first eleven
months of this fiscal year as compared to
same period last year. Moreover, the current
account posted a surplus since March 2023.
Such performance has been realized
despite reduction in remittances.

The stock market performed better as
compared to the last six months' average
performance. Moreover, the stock market
performed quite well compared to other
global and regional markets.

Interna onal
Performance and
Outlook
According to World Bank's “Global
Economic Prospects-June 2023,” global
growth is projected to slow significantly from
3.1 percent in 2022 to 2.1 percent in 2023,
before a tepid recovery to 2.4 percent in
2024. The deceleration has been observed
amid persistent inflationary pressures and
tight monetary policy, expected to weigh
substantially on economic activity. Recent
banking sector stress in advanced
economies is likely to dampen business
activities through more restrictive credit
conditions. The possibility of more
widespread banking turmoil and tighter
monetary policy could result in even weaker
global growth. Rising borrowing costs in
advanced economies could lead to financial
dislocations in the more vulnerable
emerging market and developing
economies (EMDEs).
In advanced economies, growth is slowed
to 0.7 percent in 2023 from 2.6 percent in
2022. The US economy is expected to grow
by 1.1 percent in 2023 before declining to
0.8 percent in 2024 on account of elevated
interest rate and tight credit conditions. In
the Euro area, growth is estimated to
decline to 0.4 percent in 2023 from 3.5
percent in 2022, owing to the lag effect of
tight monetary policy and higher energy
prices.
The role of trade as an engine of
productivity and economic growth is now
under threat as policy interventions have
adversely affected trade relations in recent
years. The rising number of restrictions on
international trade suggests that long-term
growth could also be weakened by growing
geopolitical and economic fragmentation.
Geopolitical tensions have led to the
JUNE 2023

1

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

imposition of a wide range of restrictions on
trade in goods. The growth of global trade in
goods and services was almost twice of
output growth during 1970-2008 but
remained half during 2011-19. Goods trade
accounted for 75 percent of global trade in
goods and services during 2010-19, with a
higher share in EMDEs compared with that
in advanced economies. There is a need to
be very cautious as having a world trading
system divided into two or more blocs could
be very costly for the entire global economy.
Global inflation is projected to gradually
edge down as growth decelerates, labour
demand in many economies softens, and
commodity prices remain stable. The slow
pace of improvement means that core
inflation is expected to remain above central
bank targets in many countries throughout
2024.
Federal Reserve Bank of New York's
Survey of Consumer Expectations May2023 shows that inflation expectations
decreased to 4.1 percent, the lowest since
May 2021. Labour market expectations and
perceived job loss risk is improving.
Households' perceptions & expectations for
credit conditions and their financial
situations deteriorated slightly. According to
Federal Reserve Bank, Beige Book “US
economic activity stalled in recent months,
with job growth and inflation both slowing,
and near-term business prospects looking
slightly worse than previously”.
Most economists expect a recession in the
second half of 2023, citing the 500 basis
points worth of interest rate increases by
the Federal Reserve Bank since March
2022, when the U.S. central bank embarked
on its fastest monetary policy tightening
campaign since the 1980s to quell inflation.
US economic situation is also reflected
through the cyclical trend in WEI, which is
hovering around 1 percent in the month of
April and May (Fig-1).
The J. P. Morgan Global Composite Output
Index increased to 54.4 in May 2023, from
54.2 in April 2023, mainly contributed by the
service sector as the manufacturing sector
remained sluggish. The major growth was
registered in India, China, Japan, and the

situation of Pakistan's major trading
partners also showed through CLI, of which
China is continuously showing expansion
and reached around its potential in May
2023 (Fig-2 page: 2).
The FAO Food Price Index (FFPI) averaged
124.3 points in May 2023, declining by 3.4
points from April. The decline in May was
driven by a significant decline in the price
indices of vegetable oils, cereals, and dairy,
which is partly offset by an increase in the
sugar and meat indices.
Global commodity prices fell in May 2023.
Energy prices declined by 11.3 percent, led
by natural gas in Europe at 25.2 percent
and coal at 17.4 percent. Non-energy prices
fell by 3.6 percent. Food prices are down
by 3.1 percent. Fertilizer prices dropped 2.2
percent. Metal price declined 6.4 percent
led by zinc 10.5 percent and iron ore 10.4
percent. Precious metal eased by 0.5
percent.

Performance of
Pakistan's
Economy
2.1 Real Sector
2.1-a Agriculture
In the Annual Plan, agriculture sector is
targeted to grow at 3.5 percent in FY2024.
This target is planned to be achieved
through 3.0 percent growth in important
crops, 3.5 percent growth in other crops, 7.2
percent growth in cotton ginning, 3.6
percent growth in livestock and 3.0 percent
growth both in fishery and forestry. These
targets indicate a recovery plan for
agriculture after a poor performance in the
outgoing fiscal year owing mainly to
disastrous floods. The targets are mainly
envisaged upon the availability of water;
use of certified seeds, fertilizers, pesticides;
mechanization; and easy access to
agriculture credit. Kharif 2023 crop targets
seem to be achievable due to favourable
weather conditions along with smooth and
sufficient availability of water and other
inputs.

During Jul-May FY2023, the agriculture
credit disbursement increased by 28.4
percent to Rs 1,565.3 billion compared to
Rs 1,219.3 billion last year. This was
achieved despite the overall contraction in
private-sector credit. Moreover, during May
2023, urea offtake was 459 thousand
tonnes, which increased by 10 percent
while DAP offtake was 66 thousand tonnes,
which decreased by 30.1 percent over May
2022.

2.1-b Manufacturing
Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) declined
by a single digit (9.39 percent) during JulApr FY2023 despite supply chain
disruptions, inflationary pressures, resultant
hike in input prices, and continued
contractionary stance of fiscal and monetary
policies to correct the macroeconomic
imbalances. In April 2023, LSM witnessed a
21.07 percent decline on a YoY basis, while
9.78 percent on MoM basis. During Jul-Apr
FY2023 four sectors Wearing Apparel,
Leather Products, Furniture, and Other
Manufacturing (Football) witnessed positive
growth.
The automobile sector continues to face
challenges due to an unfriendly economic
environment as the total production
declined by 36.3 percent during Jul-May
FY2023 and total sales dipped by 36.8
percent. The poor performance in the Cars
and Tractors remained the major
contributors to the overall decline of this
sector as Car production and sale plunged
by 52.6 percent and 56.1 percent,
respectively while Tractors production and
sale decreased by 43.4 percent and 45.6
percent, respectively. However, Jeeps &
Pickups performed relatively better among
others as the decline in its production is
below the average level of around 27
percent.
The sale of petroleum products dropped by
26 percent in Jul-May FY2023 to 15.3
million tons from 20.6 million tons in the
same period last year. YoY, oil sales
plunges 40 percent in May 2023 and
clocked in at 1.3 million tons. Moreover,
during Jul-May FY2023, total cement
dispatches declined by 14.9 percent to 40.5

JUNE 2023

3

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

million tons as compared to 47.6 million
tons in the same period last year. However,
in May 2023, demand for cement
dispatches increased by 19.4 percent to 4.0
million tons as compared to 3.3 million tons
in May 2022. Local cement sales by the
industry stood at 3.4 million tons in May
2023, 9.01 percent up from sales of 3.2
million tons in May 2022. Whereas exports
witnessed a healthy increase of 210.1
percent from 171,915 tons to 533,155 tons
during the same period.

2.2 Inflation
CPI inflation reached 38.0 percent on YoY
basis in May 2023 as compared to a YoY
increase of 36.4 percent in the previous
month. On the other hand, MoM inflation
rate increased to 1.6 percent in May 2023
as compared to 2.4 percent in April 2023.
Overall, CPI inflation remained elevated
during Jul-May FY2023; 29.2 percent as
against 11.3 percent in the same period last
year.
The main contributing factor was food
inflation, which remained too high owing
mainly to the disruption of supply chains
and currency depreciation leading to high
prices of imported food items. Moreover, the
supply-side effects of high cost of borrowing
and a significant jump in electricity and gas
prices also contributed to a higher inflation
rate.
The SPI for the week ended on 22nd June
2023, recorded an increase of 0.33 percent
on a weekly basis. Prices of 12 items
declined, 19 items showed no change, while
20 items witnessed an increase in prices.

2.3 Fiscal Performance
The government took various austerity and
revenue mobilization measures to contain
the fiscal deficit. Consequently, the overall
fiscal deficit has been reduced to 4.6
percent of GDP (Rs 3,929.3 billion) during
Jul-Apr FY2023 from 4.9 percent of GDP
(Rs. 3,275.2 billion) recorded in the same
period last year. The main contributing
factor to the fiscal deficit was interest
payments as the primary balance posted a
surplus of Rs. 99.1 billion in Jul-Apr FY2023
against the deficit of Rs. 890.2 billion in the

Source: FBR

last year.
Net federal revenues increased by 19.7
percent to Rs. 3,715.3 billion in the first ten
months of FY2023, up from Rs. 3,104.4
billion during the same period last year. This
significant growth in revenue has been
driven by both tax and non-tax revenues.
Non-tax collection grew by 23.8 percent to
reach Rs. 1,323.1 billion in Jul-Apr FY2023
from Rs. 1,068.5 billion in the same period
last year. The significant rise in the non-tax
collection has been realized mainly due to
higher receipts from petroleum levy, windfall
levy against crude oil, passport fee, and
markup payments received from PSEs &
others.
On the other hand, tax collection increased
by 16.1 percent (Rs. 6,210 billion in Jul-May
FY2023 as compared to Rs. 5,348 billion in
the same period last year). Growth in tax
revenue has been mainly driven by the
domestic sector; Rs. 5,382 billion domestic
tax collection during Jul-May FY2023, which
is 21 percent higher than Rs. 4,464 billion
collected in the same period of last year.
This growth has been contributed mainly by
direct taxes, which grew by 44.8 percent,
while FED increased by just 13 percent and
sales tax collection increased by a meager
1.8 percent. On the other hand, collection
from customs duty was reduced by 6.1
percent mainly due to import contraction
driven by the government's tight restrictions.
The significant increase in direct tax has
been realized on the back of high inflation
JUNE 2023

4

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

and various administrative and enforcement
measures to make the tax structure
progressive and equitable. Further, the
imposition of super tax on high-earning
persons/entities has also helped in raising
revenue.
Total expenditures grew by 15.1 percent to
Rs. 7,891.9 billion during Jul-Apr FY2023
against Rs. 6,856.5 billion in the same
period last year. Current expenditure
increased by 17.8 percent during Jul-Apr
FY2023, primarily due to a 68.9 percent
increase in markup payments. Non-markup
current expenditures on the other hand
reduced by 12.8 percent. The decline has
been observed due to considerable
reductions in subsidies and grants.

2.4 Monetary Sector
In the Monetary Policy Committee's meeting
held on June 12, 2023, the policy rate was
decided to remain at 21 percent. The
decision was based on higher inflation
outturns for April and May which were
broadly as anticipated coupled with the
expectation that domestic demand will
remain subdued amid a tight monetary
stance, domestic uncertainty, and
continuing stress on external accounts.
During 1st July – 26th May, FY2023 money
supply (M2) observed growth of 7.01
percent (Rs. 1,934.6 billion) as compared to
7.0 percent (Rs. 1,674.2 billion) in the same
period last year. Growth in money supply
was mainly contributed by domestic
borrowing as NDA of the banking sector
increased by Rs. 3,989.6 billion, which
offset the contraction in NFA by Rs. 2,055.0
billion; during the same period last year,
NDA increased by Rs. 3,230 billion, while
NFA decreased by Rs. 1,555.8 billion. The
private sector has borrowed Rs. 14.3 billion
during the period under review as compared
to borrowing of Rs. 1,422.1 billion in the last
year.

2.5 External Sector
The government's restrictive measures
resulted in a significant decline in the
current account deficit; $ 2.9 billion for JulMay FY2023 as against a deficit of $ 15.2
billion for the same period last year. This

has been mainly achieved through a
contraction in imports. The beneficial effects
of restrictive measures have been more
prominent in May 2023 as the current
account posted a surplus of $ 255 million as
compared to a deficit of $ 1,506 million in
the same month last year. Though exports
declined in the first eleven months of
FY2023 yet the decline in imports more
than offset it. During Jul-May FY2023
exports on fob declined by 12.2 percent and
reached $ 25.8 billion ($ 29.4 billion last
year), while imports declined by 23.9
percent reaching $ 49.0 billion ($ 64.3 billion
last year). Resultantly, the trade deficit
contracted to $ 23.2 billion (Jul-May
FY2023) as against $ 35.0 billion in the
same period last year.
Exports in services during Jul-May FY2023
increased by 3.4 percent to $ 6.7 billion as
against $ 6.4 billion. The imports in services
decreased by 37.5 percent to $ 7.3 billion
as compared to $ 11.6 billion in the same
period last year. The trade deficit in services
contained 88.3 percent to $0.6 billion as
against $ 5.2 billion in the same period last
year.
Commodities that contributed significantly to
exports include Raw Cotton, Fish & Fish
Preparation, Footballs, Footwear, Surgical
goods & Medical Instruments, and
Pharmaceutical products. On the other
hand, major contributors to imports include
Petroleum products, Petroleum crude,
Liquefied Natural Gas, Palm Oil, Plastic
materials, Iron & Steel, and Medicinal
products.

2.5.1 Foreign Investment
Foreign investment, though less than last
year's inflow, remained positive even in this
challenging year. Total foreign investment
recorded a net inflow of $ 294.1 million
during Jul-May FY2023 as compared to $
1,655.2 million in the same period last year.
Out of these, net FDI inflows were recorded
at $ 1,319.7 million during Jul-May FY2023,
20.7 percent less than the net FDI inflow of
$ 1,664.8 million in the same period last
year. China remained the main source of
FDI inflows by investing $ 374.3 million
(28.4 percent), flowed by Japan ($ 168.4

JUNE 2023

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

million; 12.8 percent), Switzerland ($ 140.2
million; 10.6 percent), and U.A.E ($ 129.6
million; 9.8 percent). As for as the sectoral
distribution of FDI is concerned, Power
sector attracted the highest FDI of $ 548.7
million (41.6 percent of total FDI), followed
by Financial Business ($ 279.6 million; 21.2
percent), and Oil & Gas Explorations ($
139.9 million; 10.6 percent).
On the other hand, foreign portfolio
investment recorded a net outflow of $
1,025.6 million during Jul-May FY2023 as
compared to a net outflow of only $ 9.6
million in the same period last year. This
was mainly driven by Foreign Public
Portfolio Investment, which recorded a net
outflow of $ 1,010.6 million, on account of
Sukuk repayment in December 2022. This
was a tough decision and contributed to the
net outflow of portfolio investment, yet it
improved the credibility of Pakistan and
reduced the risk of default. Foreign Private
Portfolio Investment also registered a net
outflow of $ 15.0 million during Jul-May
FY2023.

$ 4.1 billion. Commercial banks' reserves
remained at $ 5.2 billion.

2.5 Performance of the KSE Index
The performance of the stock market
remained at par with the near past average.
The KSE-100 index closed at 41,331 points
as of 31st May 2023; this was a decline of
250 points as compared to last month, but
the index was significantly above its 06
months' average i.e., 40,911. The market
capitalization of PSX settled at Rs 6,277
billion as of 31st May 2023. Moreover, the
stock market performed quite well
compared to other global and regional
markets. During April-May 2023, the KSE100 index increased by 3.6 percent (Fig-4),
second1 only to Sensex 30 of India, which
increased by 5.9 percent, while better than
other market indices like the S&P 500 of US
which increased by 1.3 percent. During the
same period, CAC 40 of France declined by
3.4 percent, while SSE Composite of China
was down by 2.8 percent.
Fig-4: Trend of Major World Standardized Indices

2.5.2 Workers' Remittances
Workers' remittances witnessed a decline
as compared to last year mainly due to the
global economic slowdown. During Jul-May
FY2023, workers' remittances were
recorded at $ 24.8 billion (12.8 percent
down from $ 28.5 billion recorded in the
same period last year). On MoM basis,
remittances decreased by 4.5 percent in
May 2023 ($ 2.1 billion) as compared to
April 2023 ($ 2.2 billion). Saudi Arabia
remained the main source of remittances
contributing 23.8 percent ($ 5,924.8 million),
followed by U.A.E (17.4 percent; $ 4,321.3
million), U.K (14.9 percent; $ 3,711.2
million), USA (11.4 percent; $ 2,824.7
million), other GCC countries (11.7 percent;
$ 2,918.2 million), EU (11.4 percent; $
2,839.5 million), Malaysia (0.4 percent; $
97.8 million), and other countries (8.8
percent; $ 2,194.3 million).

Economic
Outlook
3.1 Inflation
The inflation rate for the month of June
2023 has been projected to remain in the
range of 31-33 percent. Due to somewhat
favourable conditions discussed below, the
inflation rate in June 2023 is expected to
ease out as compared to 38 percent in May
2023.
JUNE 2023

7

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

The global supply chain has shown a little
bit improvement during the last couple of
months. The international commodity price
outlook is promising and is expected to
offset the negative impact of local currency
depreciation in Pakistan. Moreover, the
FFPI, which tracks international prices of
the most globally traded food commodities,
stood at 124.3 points in May 2023, showing
a decrease of 21.4 percent as compared to
May 2022 while the same has declined
MoM by 2.7 percent. Four of the FAO's five
food sub-indices - cereals, meat, dairy, and
vegetable oils - recorded a decline of 25.2
percent, 4.1 percent, 17.7 percent, and 48.2
percent, respectively, which would be
instrumental to lower domestic prices.
To reduce the inflationary pressure, the
government has made no change in the
administered prices of Petrol and Diesel
after slashing them down in the previous
two fortnightly episodes, which would keep
the inflation forecast on the lower side. In
the MPC's meeting held on June 12, 2023,
the policy rate was decided to remain
unchanged with the view that inflation
already reached its peak in May 2023,
inflationary expectations being in check,
and barring any unforeseen developments,
inflation is expected to start falling from
June onwards.
One more reason behind this is the higher
base effect as the YoY inflation rate stood at
21.3 percent in June 2022, while MoM
increase in prices was 6.3 percent. In
addition to this, political stability, an
expected stable exchange rate and a better
crop outlook due to timely measures like
Kissan Package would help to curb the
inflation rate.

3.2 Agriculture
The input situation for Kharif 2023 is
satisfactory contingent upon favourable
weather conditions. Moreover, it is expected
that the sector will outperform on account of
recent incentives proposed for the
agriculture sector in Budget FY2024.

3.3 Industrial Activities
The LSM cycle usually follows the cyclical
movements in the main trading partners, but

since it is focused on the main industrial
sectors and not on total GDP, it is
somewhat more volatile than the cyclical
component of GDP in Pakistan's main
export markets. Nevertheless, recently, the
cyclical LSM pattern seems to temporarily
diverge from the cyclical pattern in the main
export markets. This reflects significant
differences in economic dynamics in
Pakistan, mainly due to the necessary
domestic policy focus on external
equilibrium. External equilibrium is not a
major constraint in Pakistan's main export
markets such as the Euro area, the US, the
UK, and China. But in Pakistan, it is a
necessary step for convergence to an
equilibrium growth path, which temporarily
comes at a cost in terms of economic
growth.

3.4. Overall Economic Activity
The Monthly Economic Indicator (MEI) is
developed as a tool to distribute the past
annual GDP numbers, as reported by the
PBS, on a monthly/quarterly basis, and to
nowcast on that same frequency GDP
growth for the FY in which the National
Accounts are not yet available. Fig-6
presents the MEI on a monthly basis since
July 2019. It should be noted that some of
the data underlying the May MEI are still
provisional and may be revised next month.
The MEI calculated for the first 11 months of
the current FY, have been aligned to the
newly published national accounts for

FY2023. It seems to be the case that since
March 2023, the economy was contracting.
Accelerating inflation, increasing interest
rates, fiscal consolidation, growing political
instability and degrading confidence of
economic agents have significantly
contributed to this depressed level of
economic activity. However, this contraction
seems to be easing in May 2023; continuity
of this trend would help achieve the GDP
growth target set for FY2024.

3.5 External Sector
BoP data in the month of May shows that
exports of goods and services increased by
6.3 and 22.7 percent on YoY and MoM basis,
respectively. Whereas imports of goods and
services decreased by 29.7 percent on YoY
basis but increased by 7.3 percent on MoM
basis. An increase in exports has a somewhat
strong impact as compared to imports, which
narrowed down the trade deficit in goods and
services by 16.3 percent on MoM basis and
59.9 percent on YoY basis in May 2023.
Improved behavior in exports and moderate
imports implies further improvement in the
balance of trade in goods and services in the
month of June.
Remittances decreased by 4.3 percent on
MoM basis and 10.4 percent on YoY basis.
On the other hand, some improvement has
been observed in the primary income account
in the month of May. All these factors have
been translated into a current account surplus
of $ 255 million. For the outlook, it is expected
that remittances will improve on account of

Eid factor along with other primary and
secondary income factors; therefore, the
current account will follow its trend in the
month of June 2023.

3.6 Fiscal
During the first ten months of the current fiscal
year, net federal revenue growth exceeded
expenditure growth, thus limiting the fiscal
deficit to 4.6 percent of GDP against 4.9
percent of GDP in the same period last year.
Although rising markup payments put a major
strain on total expenditure, non-markup
spending has fallen considerably as a result of
the government's effective spending control.
Thus, the primary balance remained in
surplus during Jul-Apr FY2023. Effective
expenditure management has created
substantial space for social sector spending
as the expenditure under BISP has been
increased by 66 percent. The government is
striving hard to curtail non-essential spending
through austerity measures.
On the revenue side, despite the slowdown in
economic activity and an import contraction
policy, tax collection grew by 16.1 percent
during Jul-May FY2023 on the back of various
administrative and policy measures. The
government is highly committed to continuing
the fiscal consolidation through effective
expenditure management and domestic
resource mobilization despite unprecedented
challenges both at the domestic and external
fronts. These measures will pay off in better
fiscal outcomes towards the end of FY2023.

3.7 Final Remarks
The outgoing fiscal year has faced
unprecedented challenges. Despite this, the
first eleven months of CFY have observed
improvement on external and fiscal fronts.
Further, the economy has shown signs of
resilience, stabilization, and some recovery in
response to decisive and timely economic
policies. For the next FY, the government has
announced budget 2023-24 with a focus on
business and consumer-friendly economic
policies, aiming at economic recovery, price
stabilization, fiscal and external sector
sustainability. However, the economy is facing
some downside risks, which require the
continuation of prudent fiscal and external
sector policies for an inclusive growth path in
the coming years.
