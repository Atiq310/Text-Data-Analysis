Execu ve
Summary

T

he global economy is perilously
close to falling into recession.
World Bank has slashed the global
economic growth outlook to 1.7 percent
for 2023 from its earlier projection of 3.0
percent. Very high inﬂation has triggered
unexpectedly rapid and synchronous
monetary policy tightening around the
world. Although this tightening has been
necessary for price stability, it has
contributed to a signiﬁcant worsening of
global ﬁnancial conditions, which is
exerting a substantial drag on economic
activity. Major economies including the
United States, Euro area, and the China
are all undergoing a period of
pronounced weakness. The spillovers of
sluggish growth are exacerbating other
headwinds faced by emerging markets
and developing economies.

Real Sector
In the ongoing Rabi season 2022-23,
wheat crop sowing is estimated at 21.48
million acres which is 94 percent of
targeted area of 22.85 million acres. The
timely availability of inputs and
government pro-Agri initiatives are
playing role in the revival of agriculture
sector. The Rabi season crops production
is expected to increase due to favorable
weather conditions with timely rains.
During Jul-Dec Fy2023, the agriculture
credit disbursement increased by 31.5
percent, reached to Rs 842.4 billion from
Rs 640.8 billion compared to
corresponding period last year.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) recorded
at 24.5 percent on YoY basis in December
2022 as compared to an increase of 23.8
percent in the previous month.

Fiscal, Monetary & External
The ﬁscal deﬁcit during Jul-Nov FY2023

Flood-2022:
Efforts for Climate Justice
Ÿ During June-August 2022, ﬂash ﬂood
has affected all sectors of the
economy. Overall damage is estimated
at PKR 3.2 trillion (US$14.9 billion),
loss to the GDP at PKR 3.3 trillion
(US$15.2 billion), and total needs for
rehabilitation of damages at PKR 3.5
trillion (US$16.3 billion).
Ÿ Successful diplomacy of the
Government of Pakistan at all levels
has been vital in engaging
international agencies and countries
to step forward to deal with the
climate-induced calamity jointly.
Ÿ Conference on Climate Resilient
Pakistan 2023, co-hosted by Pakistan
and the United Nations, was held in
Geneva on January 9, 2023. Against
the call for USD 8 billion, the pledges
of almost USD 10 billion were
announced. Islamic Development
Bank alone declared to contribute an
amount of USD 4.2 billion over the
next three years (2023-2025). The
second major announcement was
made by the World Bank of USD 2
billion (not including allocation for
immediate relief), out of which USD 1.3
billion will directly contribute to
reconstruction.
Ÿ Financial pledges by Asian
Infrastructure Development Bank
amounted to USD 1 billion, whereas by
Saudi Arabia and Asian Development
Bank, these were USD 1 billion and
USD 0.5 billion, respectively. Other
contributors include France, China,

Private sector credit has observed
developments in the month of December
as it increased by Rs 458 billion
compared Rs 413.6 billion in Dec 2021,
emanated more credit demand both from
working capital and ﬁxed investment.
During 1st July – 30th December, FY23
money supply (M2) shows growth of 2.0
percent (Rs. 562.8 billion) compared to
growth of 4.3 percent (Rs. 1047.3 billion)
in last year.
The current account deﬁcit shrank to $
400 million in December 2022 as against
$ 1857 million in the same period last
year, largely reﬂecting an improvement in
the trade balance. Current Account
posted a deﬁcit of $ 3.7 billion for Jul-Dec
FY2023 as against a deﬁcit of $ 9.1 billion
last year, mainly due to a contraction in
imports.

Interna onal
Performance
and Outlook
According to Global Economic Prospects
2023, global growth in 2023 is expected
to contract to 1.7 percent from the
previous forecasts of 3.0 percent,
reﬂecting synchronous policy tightening
aimed at containing very high inﬂation,
worsening ﬁnancial conditions, and
continued disruptions from RussiaUkraine conﬂict. The sharp downturn in
growth is expected to widespread, with
forecasts in 2023 revised down for 95
percent of advanced economies and
nearly 70 percent of emerging market
and developing economies.
The growth for advanced economies is
projected to slow from 2.5percentin 2022
to 0.5percentin 2023. In the United
States, growth is forecasted to fall to 0.5
percent in 2023—1.9 percentage points
below previous forecasts. In 2023, Euroarea growth is expected at zero
percent—a downward revision of 1.9
percentage points. In China, growth is
projected at 4.3 percent in 2023—0.9

percentage point below previous
forecasts.
Excluding China, growth in emerging and
developing economies is expected to
decelerate from 3.8% in 2022 to 2.7% in
2023, reﬂecting signiﬁcantly weaker
external demand compounded by high
inﬂation, currency depreciation, tighter
ﬁnancing conditions, and other domestic
headwinds.
The FAO food prices index (FFPI)
averaged 132.4 points in December 2022,
down 2.6 points from November, marking
the nine consecutive monthly decrease.
The downward movement in the index in
December was mainly due to sharp fall in
international prices of vegetable oils,
cereal and meat prices, but partially
offset by slightly increase in prices of
sugar and dairy.
According to Institute of Supply
Management (ISM) report, US
manufacturing activity contracted for
second month in December 2022, stood
at 48.4 percent, lower than 49 percent in
November 2022. The ISM index dropped
10.4 points in 2022, the biggest annual
retreat since the Great Recession. The
contraction was led by the decline in the
new orders and production gauges
shrank, indicating a further lowering
demand. Measures of exports and
imports also contracted. This is also
reﬂected through WEI which is on
declining trend (Fig-1).

The J. P. Morgan Global Composite Output
Index increased to 48.2 in December
2022, from 48.0 in November 2022. This
marked ﬁfth consecutive month of global
contraction, though at a slower pace as
compared to November. The deceleration
in the speed of global slowdown was
supported by recovery in supply
conditions in December mainly in
manufacturing sector. However, the
outlook remains uncertain, with weak
demand conditions. Global new orders
dropped for ﬁfth month in December
2022, a further steeper fall since 2009.

The CLIs continued slowing growth in
December 2022 in OECD and major
economies, dragged down by high
inﬂation, rising interest rates and falling
share prices, the growth remained below
trend and continued to anticipate losing
momentum in the US, the UK and Canada,
as well as in the Euro area as a whole,
including Germany, France and Italy. The
CLI for China (industrial sector) shows
stabilization driven by production of
motor vehicles and share prices.
Global commodity prices declined in
December 2022. Energy prices fell by 6.2
percent, led by crude oil (10.7 percent).
Non-energy price gained 1.0 percent,
Food prices dropped 1.5 percent led by
grains 4.3 percent. Beverage prices
eased 0.2 percent while raw materials
gained 2.9 percent. Fertilizers prices

declined 6.1%. Metal prices gained 6.6

and nickel (13.2%). Precious metals
increased by 5.2 percent.

Monthly Performance of Pakistan's
Economy
2.1 Real Sector
2.1-a Agriculture
The wheat crop sowing is being estimated
at 21.48 million acres which is 94 percent
of target area of 22.85 million acres. The
government pro-Agri initiatives are
playing role in the revival of agriculture
sector productivity. The Rabi season
crops production is expected to increase
due to favorable weather conditions with
timely rains. During Jul-Dec FY2023, the
agriculture credit disbursement
increased by 31.5 percent, reached to Rs
842.4 billion from Rs 640.8 billion
compared to corresponding period last
year. During Rabi 2022-23 (December
2022), urea and DAP off-take stood at
833 thousand tonnes (39.2 percent
higher than December 2021) and 158
thousand tonnes (35.2 percent higher
than December 2021).

2.1-b Manufacturing
Monetary tightening, import compression
strategies, and recessionary global
pressure continued to suppress the
performance of the manufacturing sector
since the beginning of the current ﬁscal
year. During Jul-Nov FY2023, the LSM
witnessed a contraction of 3.6 percent
against the growth of 7.2 percent same
period last year. On YoY basis, LSM
plunged by 5.5 percent in November
2022, while over the previous month, it
grew by 3.5 percent. During the period, 5
out of 22 sectors witnessed positive
growth which includes, Wearing apparel,
Leather Products, Electrical Equipment,
Furniture, and others while it decreased
in Food, Beverages, Tobacco, Textile, Coke

The automobile sector also remained
under pressure due to compressed
economic environment. During Jul-Dec
FY2023, Car production and sale
decreased by 33.4 percent and 40.0
percent, respectively, Trucks & Buses
production and sale decreased by 23.9

The contraction of automobiles both on
the supply and demand front also
suppressed the sale of petroleum
products by 19 percent in Jul-Dec
FY2023 to 9.0 mn tons from 11.1 mn tons
in the same period last year. YoY, oil sales
decreased by 11 percent in Dec 2022 to
1.4 mn tons (1.5 mn tons in Dec 2021).
Total cement dispatches declined by 20.7
percent to 21.8 mn tons during Jul-Dec
FY2023, (27.5 mn tons last year). On YoY
basis, it declined by 15.6 percent to 3.9
mn tons in December 2022 (4.6 mn tons
in Dec 2021).

decline of 0.02 percent in December
2021. The average CPI in the ﬁrst Six
months of the current ﬁscal year is
recorded at 25.0 percent compared to
9.8 percent during the same period of
last year.
The FAO's Food price Index, which
captures the movement of most globally
traded food commodities, increased by
14.3 percent from 2021 to 2022.
Similarly, the YoY currency depreciation
is recorded at 21.9 percent from Rs.
176.5 to Rs 226.3 in December 2022.
Hence being net importer of Food
commodities the spike in inﬂationary
pressure has been observed.

The SPI for the week ended on 26
January 2022, recorded an increase of
0.45% compared to previous week.
Prices of 50% essential items either
declined or remained stable which shows
the effectiveness of policy measures.

2.3 Fiscal
The ﬁscal deﬁcit during Jul-Nov FY2023
has been contained to the same level of
1.4 percent of GDP as it was recorded in
the comparable period last year. While

GDP) last year.
The net federal revenues grew by 34.7
percent to reach Rs 1996 billion during
Jul-Nov FY2023 against Rs 1482 billion in
the comparable period of last year. Due to
a considerable collection under the SBP
proﬁt and petroleum levy, non-tax
revenue saw a remarkable increase of 58
percent. Similarly, tax collection grew by
16.1 percent during the period under
review. Thus, both tax and non-tax
revenues have contributed to achieving
signiﬁcant growth in revenues.
Total expenditure increased by 16.4
percent to Rs 3367 billion during Jul-Nov
FY2023 against Rs 2894 billion in the
same period of last year. Within the total,
current expenditures grew by 22.6
percent owing to an 83.6 percent
increase in markup payments. While
PSDP expenditures slide down to Rs 130
billion during Jul-Nov FY2023 against Rs
252 billion in the comparable period of
last year.

Domestic tax collection grew by 21.3
percent. Within domestic, sales tax was
reduced by 0.2 percent, and FED grew by
12.3. Whereas revenues from customs
duty were reduced by 2.1 percent during
the period under review.

2.4 Monetary
During 1st July – 30th December, FY23
money supply (M2) shows growth of 2.0
percent (Rs 562.8 billion) compared to
growth of 4.3 percent (Rs. 1047.3 billion)
in last year. Within M2, NFA decreased by
Rs 1153.5 billion as compared decrease
of Rs 227.5 billion in last year. Whereas,

The provisional net tax collection
increased by 17.4 percent to Rs 3428.8
billion during Jul-Dec FY2023 against Rs
2919.9 billion in the same period last
year. The increase in growth is largely
attributed to a 49 percent growth in
direct taxes.

2.4 External Sector
The Current Account posted a deﬁcit of $
3.7 billion for Jul-Dec FY2023 as against

They noted that children would also be
administered an additional vitamin A
supplement to boost their immunity
against infectious diseases.

Economic
Outlook
3.1 Inﬂation
Inﬂationary pressure is expected to calm
down gradually due to ﬂood-led damages
which have disrupted the supply of
essential items. Rising prices of onions
and wheat both are the key factors
responsible for affecting the general
price level. International commodity
prices are showing a downward trend on
a YoY basis and its impact will ultimately
be transmitted into domestic prices with
some lags after adjusting the currency
devaluation. While the government kept
the administered prices at their current
level to stabilize the overall prices but
post ﬂoods persistent shortfall of
essential crops is preventing inﬂation to
settle down.
SBP is also enacting a contractionary
monetary policy to contain inﬂationary
pressure. However, a larger portion of
volatility in the current price level is
explained by supply-side factors. Further,
the recent political and economic
uncertainties both are causing

JANUARY 2023

M O N T H LY E C O N O M I C U P D AT E & O U T L O O K

inﬂationary expectations upward. The
CPI inﬂation on YoY basis for January
2023, is forecasted in the range of 24-26
percent.

potential level. The cyclical component of
Pakistan's LSM output is obtained by
extracting the stochastic trend from the
seasonally adjusted LSM series.

3.2 Agriculture

The cyclical position of Pakistan's main
trading partners remained in the negative
territory since April 2022. In November,
LSM activity came in as expected,
implying no unexpected shocks appeared
in that month. Although some recovery in
the LSM cyclical position occurred in
November, the LSM output remains
substantially below its potential, thereby
following the cyclical downturn in the
economies of Pakistan's main export
markets. For December, a rebound of
LSM output in comparison to November
may be expected, mainly on the grounds
of a positive seasonal effect. On the other
hand, in December, the YoY growth of LSM
may turn out to be slightly negative due to
current economic conditions and also
due to a high base effect.

According to PMD's Weather Outlook for
January 2023, overall, a tendency for
normal to below normal precipitation is
likely over the country during January.
Due to the dry condition, the Rabi crops
especially “wheat” would need to be
irrigated for healthier growth at the initial
stages. Moreover, frost is also expected
to occur at a few places in upper Punjab,
KP, and Kashmir, etc., especially during
the 1st fortnight of January. Accordingly,
precautionary measures would be
required to protect vegetables and
orchards.
The government focuses on subsidized
provision of inputs particularly quality
seeds and fertilizers along-with other
ﬁnancial incentives will support the
agriculture sector.

3.3 Industrial Activities
Industrial activity, measured by the LSM
index is the sector that is most exposed to
the developments in international
markets as illustrated in Fig-8. It
compares the cyclical component of LSM
with the weighted average CLI in
Pakistan's main export markets. The CLI
reﬂects the deviation of GDP from its
Fig-8: Relationship between CLI and LSM cycle

3.4 Overall Economic Activity
The Monthly Economic Indicator (MEI) is
based on combining monthly data of
indicators that are proven to be
correlated with GDP at constant prices.
Fig-9 presents the MEI on monthly basis
since July 2019. It should be noted that
some of the data underlying the
December MEI is still provisional and may
be revised next month.
In Pakistan, economic activity is following

a lower growth path since the start of the
current ﬁscal year. This is also reﬂected
by the negative growth of several highfrequency variables such as cement
dispatches, oil sales, industrial
production, etc. Furthermore, the
slowdown in global growth especially in
main export markets along with the tight
monetary policy stance by central banks
(17 percent policy rate in January 2023)
and low export growth also affected
economic growth in Pakistan negatively.
The average MEI growth during the ﬁrst
half of the current FY points to slightly
positive, but the indicator is deteriorating
somewhat during the second quarter of
the current FY.

3.5 External
According to BOP data, exports of goods
decreased by 21.6 percent on YoY basis
in the month of December 2022, and
exports of services declined by 3.2
percent. As a result, exports of goods and
services declined by 18.1 percent in Dec.
Usually, the month of December has
observed a strong positive seasonal
effect which has played some role and
total exports increased by 2.3 percent on
MoM basis.
On the other hand, imports of goods
decreased by 34.4 percent on YoY basis
and 2.7 percent on MoM basis in Dec
2022. Similarly, the import of services
declined by 44.5 percent on YoY basis.
Accordingly, imports of goods and
services decreased by 35.9 percent. As
the imports fell more than the decline in
exports, the trade balance of goods and
services improved by 52.3 percent.
Exports are constrained by domestic
production issues related to the
slowdown of demand in the main export
markets and high domestic production
costs. Imports are currently constrained
by sluggish domestic demand and
administrative measures to protect the
ofﬁcial foreign reserves level. Since no
immediate reversal of these
developments is envisaged, the trade
balance may further stabilize or further
improve somewhat in the upcoming

months.
The current account balance slightly
deteriorated in the month of December.
This was mainly due to an increase in
primary income payments and a
decrease in remittances. It is expected
that in January these payments would
return to normal levels. Together with the
expected improvement in the trade
balance due to prudent government
measures, the current account deﬁcit
may decline in January and stabilize
during second half of FY2023.

3.6 Fiscal
Geopolitical tension, tightening ﬁnancial
conditions, and rising inﬂation have all
had a considerable negative inﬂuence on
growth expectations, creating severe
challenges for the global economic
environment and Pakistan is no
exception. The government of Pakistan
has adopted tight ﬁscal and monetary
policies to combat the economic
problems brought on by both internal and
external forces.
Currently, the government is facing the
difﬁcult task of supporting vulnerable
segments of society and meeting other
public spending needs, in particular,
rising interest servicing. However, due to
prudent spending management and
effective domestic resource mobilization,
the ﬁscal deﬁcit was not only conﬁned to
the same level of 1.4 percent of GDP as
last year but the primary balance surplus
was also maintained during the ﬁrst ﬁve
months.
Nonetheless, rising interest payments
due to increase in domestic and foreign
interest rates, as well as ﬂood-related
spending, can put extensive pressure on
overall spending. Furthermore, despite
massive import compression. FBR tax
collection has increased by more than 17
percent, yet it has registered a shortfall
of Rs 217 billion in the ﬁrst half of the
current ﬁscal year. In light of current
global and domestic economic conditions,
FBR facing a difﬁcult task in meeting the
full-year target.

In the absence of adequate ﬁscal space
to mitigate the impact of various shocks
on the economy, the government's
options would be to reallocate
expenditures toward critical areas while
improving spending efﬁciency; and
raising revenue by broadening the tax
base, making the tax system more
progressive, and reducing tax avoidance
and evasion.

3.7 Final Remarks
Pakistan is currently confronted with the
challenges like high inﬂation, low growth,
and low levels of ofﬁcial foreign exchange
reserves. Further MoM increases in
consumer prices may be countered by a
further mean reverting international
commodity prices and some exchange
rate stability due to decreased pace of
depreciation. The overall money supply

growth remains compatible with a return
to low and stable inﬂation. But the
outlook of M2 is broadly dependent on
ﬁscal accounts which are under immense
pressure on account of heavy interest
payments and rehabilitation spending.
Nonetheless, the ﬁrst ﬁve months of CFY
have ended with some developments;
containing ﬁscal deﬁcit and surplus in
primary balance due to effective ﬁscal
management. Fiscal consolidation is key
to saving ofﬁcial reserves and exchange
rate stability. This may temporarily be
costly in terms of growth prospects in the
short term, but long-run prosperity and
growth can only be achieved by
augmenting the country's long-term
equilibrium growth path by expanding
production capacities and productivity.
This is a shared responsibility of both the
private and public sectors.
